  abstract    = {This paper introduces a new rain removal model based on the shrinkage of the sparse codes for a single image. Recently, dictionary learning and sparse coding have been widely used for image restoration problems. These methods can also be applied to the rain removal by learning two types of rain and non-rain dictionaries and forcing the sparse codes of the rain dictionary to be zero vectors. However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail loss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for shrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink the sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the input rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the learned rain dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain and non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of objects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In the rain regions, the correlation matrix between the rain and non-rain dictionaries is calculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated signal-atoms in the rain and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to improve the removal of the rain structures. The experimental results show that the proposed shrinkage-based sparse coding can preserve image structures and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions, and it can remove the rain structures in the rain regions. Also, visual quality evaluation confirms that the proposed method outperforms the conventional texture and rain removal methods.},

  abstract    = {This letter proposes a simple method of transferring rain structures of a given exemplar rain image into a target image. Given the exemplar rain image and its corresponding masked rain image, rain patches including rain structures are extracted randomly, and then residual rain patches are obtained by subtracting those rain patches from their mean patches. Next, residual rain patches are selected randomly, and then added to the given target image along a raster scanning direction. To decrease boundary artifacts around the added patches on the target image, minimum error boundary cuts are found using dynamic programming, and then blending is conducted between overlapping patches. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can generate realistic rain images that have similar rain structures in the exemplar images. Moreover, it is expected that the proposed method can be used for rain removal. More specifically, natural images and synthetic rain images generated via the proposed method can be used to learn classifiers, for example, deep neural networks, in a supervised manner.},

  abstract    = {Most advances in single image de-raining meet a key challenge, which is removing rain streaks with different scales and shapes while preserving image details. Existing single image de-raining approaches treat rain-streak removal as a process of pixel-wise regression directly. However, they are lacking in mining the balance between over-de-raining (e.g. removing texture details in rain-free regions) and under-de-raining (e.g. leaving rain streaks). In this paper, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine network called Gradual Network (GraNet) consisting of coarse stage and fine stage for delving into single image de-raining with different granularities. Specifically, to reveal coarse-grained rain-streak characteristics (e.g. long and thick rain streaks/raindrops), we propose a coarse stage by utilizing local-global spatial dependencies via a local-global subnetwork composed of region-aware blocks. Taking the residual result (the coarse de-rained result) between the rainy image sample (i.e. the input data) and the output of coarse stage (i.e. the learnt rain mask) as input, the fine stage continues to de-rain by removing the fine-grained rain streaks (e.g. light rain streaks and water mist) to get a rain-free and well-reconstructed output image via a unified contextual merging sub-network with dense blocks and a merging block. Solid and comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our GraNet can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods by removing rain streaks with various densities, scales and shapes while keeping the image details of rain-free regions well-preserved.},

  abstract    = {Rain streaks will inevitably be captured by some outdoor vision systems, which lowers the image visual quality and also interferes various computer vision applications. We present a novel rain removal method in this paper, which consists of two steps, i.e., detection of rain streaks and reconstruction of the rain-removed image. An accurate detection of rain streaks determines the quality of the overall performance. To this end, we first detect rain streaks according to pixel intensities, motivated by the observation that rain streaks often possess higher intensities compared to other neighboring image structures. Some mis-detected locations are then refined through a morphological processing and the principal component analysis (PCA) such that only locations corresponding to real rain streaks are retained. In the second step, we separate image gradients into a background layer and a rain streak layer, thanks to the image quasi-sparsity prior, so that a rain image can be decomposed into a background layer and a rain layer. We validate the effectiveness of our method through quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We show that our method can remove rain (even for some relatively bright rain) from images robustly and outperforms some state-of-the-art rain removal algorithms.},

However, the existing learning based rain removal approaches for videos suffer from insufficient training data, especially when applying deep learning to remove rain. In this paper, we establish a large-scale video database for rain removal (LasVR), which consists of 316 rain videos. Then, we observe from our database that there exist the temporal correlation of clean content and similar patterns of rain across video frames. According to these two observations, we propose a two-stream convolutional long- and short- term memory (ConvLSTM) approach for rain removal in videos. The first stream is composed of the subnet for rain detection, while the second stream is the subnet of rain removal that leverages the features from the rain detection subnet. Finally, the experimental results on both synthetic and real rain videos show the proposed approach performs better than other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract    = {Removing rain streaks from a single image continues to draw attentions today in outdoor vision systems. In this paper, we present an efficient method to remove rain streaks. First, the location map of rain pixels needs to be known as precisely as possible, to which we implement a relatively accurate detection of rain streaks by utilizing two characteristics of rain streaks.The key component of our method is to represent the intensity of each detected rain pixel using a linear model: $p=\alpha s + \beta$, where $p$ is the observed intensity of a rain pixel and $s$ represents the intensity of the background (i.e., before rain-affected). To solve $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for each detected rain pixel, we concentrate on a window centered around it and form an $L_2$-norm cost function by considering all detected rain pixels within the window, where the corresponding rain-removed intensity of each detected rain pixel is estimated by some neighboring non-rain pixels. By minimizing this cost function, we determine $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so as to construct the final rain-removed pixel intensity. Compared with several state-of-the-art works, our proposed method can remove rain streaks from a single color image much more efficiently - it offers not only a better visual quality but also a speed-up of several times to one degree of magnitude.},

  abstract    = {Varying weather conditions, including rainfall and snowfall, are generally regarded as a challenge for computer vision algorithms. One proposed solution to the challenges induced by rain and snowfall is to artificially remove the rain from images or video using rain removal algorithms. It is the promise of these algorithms that the rain-removed image frames will improve the performance of subsequent segmentation and tracking algorithms. However, rain removal algorithms are typically evaluated on their ability to remove synthetic rain on a small subset of images. Currently, their behavior is unknown on real-world videos when integrated with a typical computer vision pipeline. In this paper, we review the existing rain removal algorithms and propose a new dataset that consists of 22 traffic surveillance sequences under a broad variety of weather conditions that all include either rain or snowfall. We propose a new evaluation protocol that evaluates the rain removal algorithms on their ability to improve the performance of subsequent segmentation, instance segmentation, and feature tracking algorithms under rain and snow. If successful, the de-rained frames of a rain removal algorithm should improve segmentation performance and increase the number of accurately tracked features. The results show that a recent single-frame-based rain removal algorithm increases the segmentation performance by 19.7% on our proposed dataset, but it eventually decreases the feature tracking performance and showed mixed results with recent instance segmentation methods. However, the best video-based rain removal algorithm improves the feature tracking accuracy by 7.72%.},

  abstract    = {Removing rain streaks from a single image has been drawing considerable attention as rain streaks can severely degrade the image quality and affect the performance of existing outdoor vision tasks. While recent CNN-based derainers have reported promising performances, deraining remains an open problem for two reasons. First, existing synthesized rain datasets have only limited realism, in terms of modeling real rain characteristics such as rain shape, direction and intensity. Second, there are no public benchmarks for quantitative comparisons on real rain images, which makes the current evaluation less objective. The core challenge is that real world rain/clean image pairs cannot be captured at the same time. In this paper, we address the single image rain removal problem in two ways. First, we propose a semi-automatic method that incorporates temporal priors and human supervision to generate a high-quality clean image from each input sequence of real rain images. Using this method, we construct a large-scale dataset of $\sim$$29.5K$ rain/rain-free image pairs that covers a wide range of natural rain scenes. Second, to better cover the stochastic distribution of real rain streaks, we propose a novel SPatial Attentive Network (SPANet) to remove rain streaks in a local-to-global manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deraining methods.},

  abstract    = {Single image deraining regards an input image as a fusion of a background image, a transmission map, rain streaks, and atmosphere light. While advanced models are proposed for image restoration (i.e., background image generation), they regard rain streaks with the same properties as background rather than transmission medium. As vapors (i.e., rain streaks accumulation or fog-like rain) are conveyed in the transmission map to model the veiling effect, the fusion of rain streaks and vapors do not naturally reflect the rain image formation. In this work, we reformulate rain streaks as transmission medium together with vapors to model rain imaging. We propose an encoder-decoder CNN named as SNet to learn the transmission map of rain streaks. As rain streaks appear with various shapes and directions, we use ShuffleNet units within SNet to capture their anisotropic representations. As vapors are brought by rain streaks, we propose a VNet containing spatial pyramid pooling (SSP) to predict the transmission map of vapors in multi-scales based on that of rain streaks. Meanwhile, we use an encoder CNN named ANet to estimate atmosphere light. The SNet, VNet, and ANet are jointly trained to predict transmission maps and atmosphere light for rain image restoration. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual model to predict rain streaks and vapors.

  abstract    = {In this paper, we address a rain removal problem from a single image, even in the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation. Our core ideas lie in the new rain image models and a novel deep learning architecture. We first modify an existing model comprising a rain streak layer and a background layer, by adding a binary map that locates rain streak regions. Second, we create a new model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation (where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or fog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the first model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the binary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean background, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is critically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong information to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a phenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal network that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation iteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new contextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual information and outputs better representation for rain detection. The evaluation on real images, particularly on heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our novel models and architecture, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

Against this generalization issue, this study proposes a new network architecture by enforcing the output residual of the network possess intrinsic rain structures. Such a structural residual setting guarantees the rain layer extracted by the network finely comply with the prior knowledge of general rain streaks, and thus regulates sound rain shapes capable of being well extracted from rainy images in both training and predicting stages. Such a general regularization function naturally leads to both its better training accuracy and testing generalization capability even for those non-seen rain configurations. Such superiority is comprehensively substantiated by experiments implemented on synthetic and real datasets both visually and quantitatively as compared with current state-of-the-art methods.},

Experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms many existing universal blind image quality assessment models. To help the research towards perceptually preferred de-raining algorithm, we will publicly release our DQA database and B-FEN source code on https://github.com/wqb-uestc.},

To better fit the rain removal task, we also modify the network. In heavy rain, rain streaks have various directions and shapes, which can be regarded as the accumulation of multiple rain streak layers. We assign different alpha-values to various rain streak layers according to the intensity and transparency by incorporating the squeeze-and-excitation block. Since rain streak layers overlap with each other, it is not easy to remove the rain in one stage. So we further decompose the rain removal into multiple stages. Recurrent neural network is incorporated to preserve the useful information in previous stages and benefit the rain removal in later stages.

Therefore, haar wavelet transform is a good choice to separate the rain streaks and background to some extent. More specifically, the LL subband of a rain image is more inclined to express the background information, while LH, HL, HH subband tend to represent the rain streaks and the edges. On the other hand, the accumulation of rain streaks from long distance makes the rain image look like haze veil. We extract dark channel of rain image as a feature map in network. By increasing this mapping between the dark channel of input and output images, we achieve haze removal in an indirect way. All of the parameters are optimized by back-propagation.

  abstract    = {Rain is a common phenomenon in nature and an essential factor for many deep neural network (DNN) based perception systems. Rain can often post inevitable threats that must be carefully addressed especially in the context of safety and security-sensitive scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the potential risks of the rain to a DNN is of great importance. Unfortunately, in practice, it is often rather difficult to collect or synthesize rainy images that can represent all raining situations that possibly occur in the real world. To this end, in this paper, we start from a new perspective and propose to combine two totally different studies, i.e., rainy image synthesis and adversarial attack. We present an adversarial rain attack, with which we could simulate various rainy situations with the guidance of deployed DNNs and reveal the potential threat factors that can be brought by rain, helping to develop more rain-robust DNNs. In particular, we propose a factor-aware rain generation that simulates rain steaks according to the camera exposure process and models the learnable rain factors for adversarial attack. With this generator, we further propose the adversarial rain attack against the image classification and object detection, where the rain factors are guided by the various DNNs. As a result, it enables to comprehensively study the impacts of the rain factors to DNNs. Our largescale evaluation on three datasets, i.e., NeurIPS'17 DEV, MS COCO and KITTI, demonstrates that our synthesized rainy images can not only present visually realistic appearances, but also exhibit strong adversarial capability, which builds the foundation for further rain-robust perception studies.},

  abstract    = {The objective of this work is to provide high-resolution rain rate maps at short lead-time forecasts (nowcasts) necessary to anticipate flooding and properly manage sewage systems in urban areas by combining radars, rain gauges, and operational microwave links, and taking into account their respective uncertainties. A variational approach (3D-Var) is used to find the best estimate for the rain rate, and its error covariance, from the different rain sensors. Short-term rain rate forecasts are then produced by assuming Lagrangian persistence. A velocity field is obtained from the operational radar-derived rain fields, and the rain rate field is advected using the Total Variance Diminishing (TVD) scheme. The error covariance associated to the estimated rain rate is also propagated, and we use these two in the 3D-Var at the next observation time step. This approach can be seen as a Variational Kalman Filter (VKF), in which the covariance of the prior is not constant but dependent on time. The proposed approach has been tested using data from 14 rain gauges, 14 microwave links and the operational radar rain product from MeteoSwiss in the area of Zurich (Switzerland). During the applications the assumption of the Lagrangian persistence appears to be valid up to 20 min (a bit longer for stratiform events). During convective events, the algorithm is less powerful and shorter lead times should be considered (i.e., 15 min). Although such lead times are short, they are still useful to various hydrological and outdoor applications.},

  abstract    = {Optical flow estimation in the rainy scenes is challenging due to background degradation introduced by rain streaks and rain accumulation effects in the scene. Rain accumulation effect refers to poor visibility of remote objects due to the intense rainfall. Most existing optical flow methods are erroneous when applied to rain sequences because the conventional brightness constancy constraint (BCC) and gradient constancy constraint (GCC) generally break down in this situation. Based on the observation that the RGB color channels receive raindrop radiance equally, we introduce a residue channel as a new data constraint to reduce the effect of rain streaks. To handle rain accumulation, our method decomposes the image into a piecewise-smooth background layer and a high-frequency detail layer. It also enforces the BCC on the background layer only. Results on both synthetic dataset and real images show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods on different types of rain sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first optical flow method specifically dealing with rain.},

To tackle this problem, we propose Deep Symmetry Enhanced Network~(DSEN) that is able to explicitly extract the rotation equivariant features from rain images. In addition, we design a self-refining mechanism to remove the accumulated rain streaks in a coarse-to-fine manner. This mechanism reuses DSEN with a novel information link which passes the gradient flow to the higher stages.

Through a shared deep neural network, the rain that is removed from the first image is then added to the clean image to generate a second pair ("clean-to-rain"). The neural network simultaneously learns to map both images such that high resolution structure in the clean images can inform the deraining of the rainy images.

This varying characteristic of rain streaks affect different parts of the image differently. Previous approaches have attempted to address this problem by leveraging some prior information to remove rain streaks from a single image. One of the major limitations of these approaches is that they do not consider the location information of rain drops in the image. The proposed Image Quality-based single image Deraining using Confidence measure (QuDeC), network addresses this issue by learning the quality or distortion level of each patch in the rainy image, and further processes this information to learn the rain content at different scales. In addition, we introduce a technique which guides the network to learn the network weights based on the confidence measure about the estimate of both quality at each location and residual rain streak information (residual map).

In recent time, rain streak removal achieves lots of interest to the researchers as it has some exciting applications such as autonomous car, intelligent traffic monitoring system, multimedia, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple method by combining three novel extracted features focusing on temporal appearance, wide shape and relative location of the rain streak and we called it TAWL (Temporal Appearance, Width, and Location) method. The proposed TAWL method adaptively uses features from different resolutions and frame rates. Moreover, it progressively processes features from the up-coming frames so that it can remove rain in the real-time. The experiments have been conducted using video sequences with both real rains and synthetic rains to compare the performance of the proposed method against the relevant state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by removing more rain streaks while keeping other moving regions.},

Inside the DAM, there are two attentive maps - each of which attends to the heavy and light rainy regions, respectively, to guide the deraining process differently for applicable regions. In addition, to further refine the result, a Differential-driven Dual Attention-in-Attention Model (D-DAiAM) is proposed with a "heavy-to-light" scheme to remove rain via addressing the unsatisfying deraining regions. Extensive experiments on one public raindrop dataset, one public rain streak and our synthesized joint rain streak and raindrop (JRSRD) dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method not only is capable of removing rain streaks and raindrops simultaneously, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both tasks.},

To meet this requirement, extremely high frequency (EHF), particularly Q (36 to 46 GHz) and V (46 to 56 GHz) bands, is the best viable solution because of its complete availability. The most serious challenge the EHF band poses is the attenuation caused by rain. This paper investigates the effect of the rain on Q and V bands' performances in Bangladeshi climatic conditions. The rain attenuations of the two bands are predicted for the four main regions of Bangladesh using ITU rain attenuation model. The measured rain statistics is used for this prediction. It is observed that the attenuation due to rain in the Q/V band reaches up to 150 dB which is much higher than that of the currently used Ka band. The variability of the rain attenuation is also investigated over different sessions of Bangladesh. The attenuation varies from 40 dB to 170 dB depending on the months. Finally, the amount of rain fade required to compensate the high rain attenuation is also predicted for different elevation angles.},

  abstract    = {Single image rain removal is a typical inverse problem in computer vision. The deep learning technique has been verified to be effective for this task and achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, previous deep learning methods need to pre-collect a large set of image pairs with/without synthesized rain for training, which tends to make the neural network be biased toward learning the specific patterns of the synthesized rain, while be less able to generalize to real test samples whose rain types differ from those in the training data. To this issue, this paper firstly proposes a semi-supervised learning paradigm toward this task. Different from traditional deep learning methods which only use supervised image pairs with/without synthesized rain, we further put real rainy images, without need of their clean ones, into the network training process. This is realized by elaborately formulating the residual between an input rainy image and its expected network output (clear image without rain) as a specific parametrized rain streaks distribution. The network is therefore trained to adapt real unsupervised diverse rain types through transferring from the supervised synthesized rain, and thus both the short-of-training-sample and bias-to-supervised-sample issues can be evidently alleviated. Experiments on synthetic and real data verify the superiority of our model compared to the state-of-the-arts.},

In heavy rain, streaks are strongly visible, dense rain accumulation or rain veiling effect significantly washes out the image, further scenes are relatively more blurry, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these problems. We put forth a 2-stage network: a physics-based backbone followed by a depth-guided GAN refinement. The first stage estimates the rain streaks, the transmission, and the atmospheric light governed by the underlying physics. To tease out these components more reliably, a guided filtering framework is used to decompose the image into its low- and high-frequency components. This filtering is guided by a rain-free residue image --- its content is used to set the passbands for the two channels in a spatially-variant manner so that the background details do not get mixed up with the rain-streaks. For the second stage, the refinement stage, we put forth a depth-guided GAN to recover the background details failed to be retrieved by the first stage, as well as correcting artefacts introduced by that stage. We have evaluated our method against the state of the art methods.

It is found that rain attenuation is the most severe in Sylhet and least in Rajshahi. The attenuation is estimated for different frequency and polarization. A horizontally polarized signal encounters 15% more rain attenuation than that of vertically polarized signal. It is also found that attenuation in Rajshahi is about 20% lesser than that in Sylhet.

Current rain removal methods show limitations either for complex dynamic scenes shot from fast moving cameras, or under torrential rain fall with opaque occlusions. We propose a novel derain algorithm, which applies superpixel (SP) segmentation to decompose the scene into depth consistent units. Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be robust towards rain occlusion and fast camera motion. Two alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for rain streak location and occluded background contents to generate an intermediate derain output. These tensors will be subsequently prepared as input features for a convolutional neural network to restore high frequency details to the intermediate output for compensation of mis-alignment blur. Extensive evaluations show that up to 5 dB reconstruction PSNR advantage is achieved over state-of-the-art methods. Visual inspection shows that much cleaner rain removal is achieved especially for highly dynamic scenes with heavy and opaque rainfall from a fast moving camera.},

We validate our rendering with a user study, proving our rain is judged 40% more realistic that state-of-the-art. Using our generated weather augmented Kitti and Cityscapes dataset, we conduct a thorough evaluation of deep object detection and semantic segmentation algorithms and show that their performance decreases in degraded weather, on the order of 15% for object detection and 60% for semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we show refining existing networks with our augmented images improves the robustness of both object detection and semantic segmentation algorithms. We experiment on nuScenes and measure an improvement of 15% for object detection and 35% for semantic segmentation compared to original rainy performance. Augmented databases and code are available on the project page.},

  abstract    = {Rain severely hampers the visibility of scene objects when images are captured through glass in heavily rainy days. We observe three intriguing phenomenons that, 1) rain is a mixture of raindrops, rain streaks and rainy haze; 2) the depth from the camera determines the degrees of object visibility, where objects nearby and faraway are visually blocked by rain streaks and rainy haze, respectively; and 3) raindrops on the glass randomly affect the object visibility of the whole image space. We for the first time consider that, the overall visibility of objects is determined by the mixture of rain (MOR). However, existing solutions and established datasets lack full consideration of the MOR. In this work, we first formulate a new rain imaging model; by then, we enrich the popular RainCityscapes by considering raindrops, named RainCityscapes++. Furthermore, we propose a multi-branch attention generative adversarial network (termed an MBA-RainGAN) to fully remove the MOR. The experiment shows clear visual and numerical improvements of our approach over the state-of-the-arts on RainCityscapes++. The code and dataset will be available.},

  abstract    = {Rain streak removal is an important issue and has recently been investigated extensively. Existing methods, especially the newly emerged deep learning methods, could remove the rain streaks well in many cases. However the essential factor in the generative procedure of the rain streaks, i.e., the motion blur, which leads to the line pattern appearances, were neglected by the deep learning rain streaks approaches and this resulted in over-derain or under-derain results. In this paper, we propose a novel rain streak removal approach using a kernel guided convolutional neural network (KGCNN), achieving the state-of-the-art performance with simple network architectures. We first model the rain streak interference with its motion blur mechanism. Then, our framework starts with learning the motion blur kernel, which is determined by two factors including angle and length, by a plain neural network, denoted as parameter net, from a patch of the texture component. Then, after a dimensionality stretching operation, the learned motion blur kernel is stretched into a degradation map with the same spatial size as the rainy patch. The stretched degradation map together with the texture patch is subsequently input into a derain convolutional network, which is a typical ResNet architecture and trained to output the rain streaks with the guidance of the learned motion blur kernel. Experiments conducted on extensive synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which preserves the texture and the contrast while removing the rain streaks.},

  abstract    = {Video rain/snow removal from surveillance videos is an important task in the computer vision community since rain/snow existed in videos can severely degenerate the performance of many surveillance system. Various methods have been investigated extensively, but most only consider consistent rain/snow under stable background scenes. Rain/snow captured from practical surveillance camera, however, is always highly dynamic in time with the background scene transformed occasionally. To this issue, this paper proposes a novel rain/snow removal approach, which fully considers dynamic statistics of both rain/snow and background scenes taken from a video sequence. Specifically, the rain/snow is encoded as an online multi-scale convolutional sparse coding (OMS-CSC) model, which not only finely delivers the sparse scattering and multi-scale shapes of real rain/snow, but also well encodes their temporally dynamic configurations by real-time ameliorated parameters in the model. Furthermore, a transformation operator imposed on the background scenes is further embedded into the proposed model, which finely conveys the dynamic background transformations, such as rotations, scalings and distortions, inevitably existed in a real video sequence. The approach so constructed can naturally better adapt to the dynamic rain/snow as well as background changes, and also suitable to deal with the streaming video attributed its online learning mode. The proposed model is formulated in a concise maximum a posterior (MAP) framework and is readily solved by the ADMM algorithm. Compared with the state-of-the-art online and offline video rain/snow removal methods, the proposed method achieves better performance on synthetic and real videos datasets both visually and quantitatively. Specifically, our method can be implemented in relatively high efficiency, showing its potential to real-time video rain/snow removal.},

With the MPI-AMRVAC code, we performed three dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation with strong heating localized on footpoints of magnetic loops after a relaxation to quiet solar atmosphere. Progressive cooling and in-situ condensation starts at the loop top due to radiative thermal instability. The first large-scale condensation on the loop top suffers Rayleigh-Taylor instability and becomes fragmented into smaller blobs. The blobs fall vertically dragging magnetic loops until they reach low beta regions and start to fall along the loops from loop top to loop footpoints. A statistic study of the coronal rain blobs finds that small blobs with masses of less than 10^10 g dominate the population. When blobs fall to lower regions along the magnetic loops, they are stretched and develop a non-uniform velocity pattern with an anti-parallel shearing pattern seen to develop along the central axis of the blobs. Synthetic images of simulated coronal rain with Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly well resemble real observations presenting dark falling clumps in hot channels and bright rain blobs in a cool channel. We also find density inhomogeneities during a coronal rain "shower", which reflects the observed multi-stranded nature of coronal rain.},

We are particularly concerned with heavy rain, where rain streaks of various sizes and directions can overlap each other and the veiling effect reduces contrast severely. To achieve our goal, we introduce a scale-aware multi-stage convolutional neural network. Our main idea here is that different sizes of rain-streaks visually degrade the scene in different ways. Large nearby streaks obstruct larger regions and are likely to reflect specular highlights more prominently than smaller distant streaks. These different effects of different streaks have their own characteristics in their image features, and thus need to be treated differently. To realize this, we create parallel sub-networks that are trained and made aware of these different scales of rain streaks. To our knowledge, this idea of parallel sub-networks that treats the same class of objects according to their unique sub-classes is novel, particularly in the context of rain removal. To verify our idea, we conducted experiments on both synthetic and real images, and found that our method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Recent deep learning models are proposed to learn end-to-end methods to complete this task. However, they often fail to obtain satisfactory results in many realistic scenarios, especially when the observed images suffer from heavy rain. Heavy rain brings not only rain streaks but also haze-like effect caused by the accumulation of tiny raindrops. Different from the existing deep learning deraining methods that mainly focus on handling the rain streaks, we design a deep neural network by incorporating a physical raining image model. Specifically, in the proposed model, two branches are designed to handle both the rain streaks and haze-like effects. An additional submodule is jointly trained to finally refine the results, which give the model flexibility to control the strength of removing the mist. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both objective assessments and visual quality.},

  abstract    = {Rain removal in images/videos is still an important task in computer vision field and attracting attentions of more and more people. Traditional methods always utilize some incomplete priors or filters (e.g. guided filter) to remove rain effect. Deep learning gives more probabilities to better solve this task. However, they remove rain either by evaluating background from rainy image directly or learning a rain residual first then subtracting the residual to obtain a clear background. No other models are used in deep learning based de-raining methods to remove rain and obtain other information about rainy scenes. In this paper, we utilize an extensively-used image degradation model which is derived from atmospheric scattering principles to model the formation of rainy images and try to learn the transmission, atmospheric light in rainy scenes and remove rain further. To reach this goal, we propose a robust evaluation method of global atmospheric light in a rainy scene. Instead of using the estimated atmospheric light directly to learn a network to calculate transmission, we utilize it as ground truth and design a simple but novel triangle-shaped network structure to learn atmospheric light for every rainy image, then fine-tune the network to obtain a better estimation of atmospheric light during the training of transmission network. Furthermore, more efficient ShuffleNet Units are utilized in transmission network to learn transmission map and the de-raining image is then obtained by the image degradation model. By subjective and objective comparisons, our method outperforms the selected state-of-the-art works.},

In this paper, we design a system for the detection of rainfall by the use of surveillance cameras.

The rain models generally introduce diversity visibility degradation, which includes rain streak, rain drop as well as rain mist. Numerous existing single image deraining methods focus on the only one type rain model, which does not have strong generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Neuron Attention Stage-by-Stage Net (NASNet), which can solve all types of rain model tasks efficiently. For one thing, we pay more attention on the Neuron relationship and propose a lightweight Neuron Attention (NA) architectural mechanism. It can adaptively recalibrate neuron-wise feature responses by modelling interdependencies and mutual influence between neurons. Our NA architecture consists of Depthwise Conv and Pointwise Conv, which has slight computation cost and higher performance than SE block by our contrasted experiments. For another, we propose a stage-by-stage unified pattern network architecture, the stage-by-stage strategy guides the later stage by incorporating the useful information in previous stage. We concatenate and fuse stage-level information dynamically by NA module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed NASNet significantly outperforms the state-of-theart methods by a large margin in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measures on all six public large-scale datasets for three rain model tasks.},

Similar rain patterns are visible in a rain image as well as its multi-scale (or multi-resolution) versions, which makes it possible to exploit such complementary information for rain streak representation. In this work, we explore the multi-scale collaborative representation for rain streaks from the perspective of input image scales and hierarchical deep features in a unified framework, termed multi-scale progressive fusion network (MSPFN) for single image rain streak removal. For similar rain streaks at different positions, we employ recurrent calculation to capture the global texture, thus allowing to explore the complementary and redundant information at the spatial dimension to characterize target rain streaks. Besides, we construct multi-scale pyramid structure, and further introduce the attention mechanism to guide the fine fusion of this correlated information from different scales. This multi-scale progressive fusion strategy not only promotes the cooperative representation, but also boosts the end-to-end training. Our proposed method is extensively evaluated on several benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we conduct experiments on joint deraining, detection, and segmentation tasks, and inspire a new research direction of vision task-driven image deraining.

Here we present a two-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into (a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in the UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for recovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the integration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain gauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning models by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at sub-hourly resolutions. Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and deployed for highly automated and near instantaneous imputation of missing values in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.},

  abstract     = {We demonstrate how, from the point of view of energy flow through an open system, rain is analogous to many other relaxational processes in Nature such as earthquakes. By identifying rain events as the basic entities of the phenomenon, we show that the number density of rain events per year is inversely proportional to the released water column raised to the power 1.4. This is the rain-equivalent of the Gutenberg-Richter law for earthquakes. The event durations and the waiting times between events are also characterised by scaling regions, where no typical time scale exists. The Hurst exponent of the rain intensity signal $H = 0.76 > 0.5$. It is valid in the temporal range from minutes up to the full duration of the signal of half a year. All of our findings are consistent with the concept of self-organised criticality, which refers to the tendency of slowly driven non-equilibrium systems towards a state of scale free behaviour.},

Our magnetic arcades host chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasma. Following coronal rain dynamics for over 80 minutes physical time, we collect enough statistics to quantify blob widths, lengths, velocity distributions, and other characteristics which directly match with modern observational knowledge. Our virtual coronal rain displays the deformation of blobs into $V$-shaped like features, interactions of blobs due to mostly pressure-mediated levitations, and gives the first views on blobs which evaporate in situ, or get siphoned over the apex of the background arcade. Our simulations pave the way for systematic surveys of coronal rain showers in true multidimensional settings, to connect parametrized heating prescriptions with rain statistics, ultimately allowing to quantify the coronal heating input.},

In particular, the sparsity of rain streaks in spatial and derivative domains, the spatiotemporal sparsity and low-rank property of video background are incorporated into the proposed method. Different from many previous methods under the assumption of vertically falling rain streaks, we consider a more realistic assumption that all the rain streaks in a video fall in an approximately similar arbitrary direction. The resulting complicated optimization problem will be effectively solved through an alternating direction method. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and realistic datasets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed deraining method.},

  abstract     = {Coronal rain is ubiquitous in flare loops, forming shortly after the onset of the solar flare. Rain is thought to be caused by a thermal instability, a localized runaway cooling of material in the corona. The models that demonstrate this require extremely long duration heating on the order of the radiative cooling time, localized near the footpoints of the loops. In flares, electron beams are thought to be the primary energy transport mechanism, driving strong footpoint heating during the impulsive phase that causes evaporation, filling and heating flare loops. Electron beams, however, do not act for a long period of time, and even supposing that they did, their heating would not remain localized at the footpoints. With a series of numerical experiments, we show directly that these two issues mean that electron beams are incapable of causing the formation of rain in flare loops. This result suggests that either there is another mechanism acting in flare loops responsible for rain, or that the modeling of the cooling of flare loops is somehow deficient. To adequately describe flares, the standard model must address this issue to account for the presence of coronal rain.},

So, deraining becomes important and an effective deraining algorithm is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel network based on physical model guided learning for single image deraining, which consists of three sub-networks: rain streaks network, rain-free network, and guide-learning network. The concatenation of rain streaks and rain-free image that are estimated by rain streaks network, rain-free network, respectively, is input to the guide-learning network to guide further learning and the direct sum of the two estimated images is constrained with the input rainy image based on the physical model of rainy image. Moreover, we further develop the Multi-Scale Residual Block (MSRB) to better utilize multi-scale information and it is proved to boost the deraining performance. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art deraining methods.

  abstract    = {Rain streaks showing in images or videos would severely degrade the performance of computer vision applications. Thus, it is of vital importance to remove rain streaks and facilitate our vision systems. While recent convolutinal neural network based methods have shown promising results in single image rain removal (SIRR), they fail to effectively capture long-range location dependencies or aggregate convolutional channel information simultaneously. However, as SIRR is a highly illposed problem, these spatial and channel information are very important clues to solve SIRR. First, spatial information could help our model to understand the image context by gathering long-range dependency location information hidden in the image. Second, aggregating channels could help our model to concentrate on channels more related to image background instead of rain streaks. In this paper, we propose a non-local channel aggregation network (NCANet) to address the SIRR problem. NCANet models 2D rainy images as sequences of vectors in three directions, namely vertical direction, transverse direction and channel direction. Recurrently aggregating information from all three directions enables our model to capture the long-range dependencies in both channels and spaitials locations. Extensive experiments on both heavy and light rain image data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NCANet model.},

  abstract    = {Coronal rain corresponds to cool and dense clumps in the corona accreting towards the solar surface, and is often observed above solar active regions. They are generally thought to be produced by thermal instability in the corona and their lifetime is limited by the time they take to reach the chromosphere. Although the rain usually fragments into smaller clumps while falling down, their specific spatial and temporal scales remain unclear. In addition, the observational signatures of the impact of the rain with the chromosphere have not been clarified yet. In this study, we investigate the time evolution of velocity and intensity of coronal rain above a sunspot by analyzing coronal images obtained by the AIA onboard the SDO satellite as well as the Slit-Jaw Images (SJIs) and spectral data taken by the IRIS satellite. We identify dark and bright threads moving towards the umbra in AIA images and in SJIs, respectively, and co-spatial chromospheric intensity enhancements and redshifts in three IRIS spectra, Mg II k 2796 Angstrom, Si IV 1394 Angstrom, and C II 1336 Angstrom. The intensity enhancements and coronal rain redshifts occur almost concurrently in all the three lines, which clearly demonstrates the causal relationship with coronal rain. Furthermore, we detect bursty intensity variation with a timescale shorter than 1 minute in Mg II k, Si IV and C II spectra, indicating that a length scale of rain clumps is about 2.7 Mm if we multiply the typical time scale of the busty intensity variation at 30 sec by the rain velocity at 90 $\mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. Such rapid enhancements in the IRIS lines are excited within a time lag of 5.6 sec limited by the temporal resolution. These temporal and spatial scales may reflect the physical processes responsible for the rain morphology, and are suggestive of instabilities such as Kelvin-Helmholtz.},

  abstract     = {Reported observations in H-alpha, Ca II H and K or or other chromospheric lines of coronal rain trace back to the days of the Skylab mission. Offering a high contrast in intensity with respect to the background (either bright in emission if observed at the limb, or dark in absorption if observed on disk) these cool blobs are often observed falling down from high coronal heights above active regions. A physical explanation for this spectacular phenomenon has been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint concentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally form in the corona. This effect has been termed 'catastrophic cooling' and is the predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work we further investigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting in the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb in the Ca II H line performed by the SOT instrument on board of the Hinode satellite. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD simulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated towards the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic reconnection events), and by Alfven waves generated at the photosphere. It is found that if a loop is heated predominantly from Alfven waves coronal rain is inhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence coronal rain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal loops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain as a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.},

  abstract    = {The condensations composing coronal rain, falling down along loop-like structures observed in cool chromospheric lines such as H$\alpha$ and \ion{Ca}{2} H, have long been a spectacular phenomenon of the solar corona. However, considered a peculiar sporadic phenomenon, it has not received much attention. This picture is rapidly changing due to recent high resolution observations with instruments such as \textit{Hinode}/SOT, CRISP of \textit{SST} and \textit{SDO}. Furthermore, numerical simulations have shown that coronal rain is a loss of thermal equilibrium of loops linked to footpoint heating. This result has highlighted the importance that coronal rain can play in the field of coronal heating. In this work, we further stress the importance of coronal rain by showing the role it can play in the understanding of the coronal magnetic field topology. We analyze \textit{Hinode}/SOT observations in the \ion{Ca}{2} H line of a loop in which coronal rain puts in evidence in-phase transverse oscillations of multiple strand-like structures. The periods, amplitudes, transverse velocities and phase velocities are calculated, allowing an estimation of the energy flux of the wave and the coronal magnetic field inside the loop through means of coronal seismology. We discuss the possible interpretations of the wave as either standing or propagating torsional Alfv\'en or fast kink waves. An estimate of the plasma beta parameter of the condensations indicates a condition that may allow the often observed separation and elongation processes of the condensations. We also show that the wave pressure from the transverse wave can be responsible for the observed low downward acceleration of coronal rain.},

  abstract    = {The tropical wisdom that when it is hot and dense we can expect rain might also apply to the Sun. Indeed, observations and numerical simulations have shown that strong heating at footpoints of loops, as is the case for active regions, puts their coronae out of thermal equilibrium, which can lead to a phenomenon known as catastrophic cooling. Following local pressure loss in the corona, hot plasma locally condenses in these loops and dramatically cools down to chromospheric temperatures. These blobs become bright in H-alpha and Ca II H in time scales of minutes, and their dynamics seem to be subject more to internal pressure changes in the loop rather than to gravity. They thus become trackers of the magnetic field, which results in the spectacular coronal rain that is observed falling down coronal loops. In this work we report on high resolution observations of coronal rain with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on Hinode and CRISP at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). A statistical study is performed in which properties such as velocities and accelerations of coronal rain are derived. We show how this phenomenon can constitute a diagnostic tool for the internal physical conditions inside loops. Furthermore, we analyze transverse oscillations of strand-like condensations composing coronal rain falling in a loop, and discuss the possible nature of the wave. This points to the important role that coronal rain can play in the fields of coronal heating and coronal seismology.},

The model sandy soils we use are random closely-packed glass beads with varied diameters and surface treatments. For hydrophilic sandy soils, our experiments show that rain water infiltrates into a shallow top layer of soil and creates a horizontal water wetting front that grows downward homogeneously until instabilities occur to form fingered flows. For hydrophobic sandy soils, in contrast, we observe that rain water ponds on the top of soil surface until the hydraulic pressure is strong enough to overcome the capillary repellency of soil and create narrow water channels that penetrate the soil packing. Varying the raindrop impinging speed has little influence on water channel formation. However, varying the rain rate causes significant changes in water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. At a fixed raining condition, we combine the effects of grain diameter and surface hydrophobicity into a single parameter and determine its influence on water infiltration depth, water channel width, and water channel separation. We also demonstrate the efficiency of several soil water improvement methods that relate to rain water channelization phenomenon, including pre-wetting sandy soils at different level before rainfall, modifying soil surface flatness, and applying superabsorbent hydrogel particles as soil modifiers.},

  abstract    = {Rain streak removal is an important issue in outdoor vision systems and has recently been investigated extensively. In this paper, we propose a novel video rain streak removal approach FastDeRain, which fully considers the discriminative characteristics of rain streaks and the clean video in the gradient domain. Specifically, on the one hand, rain streaks are sparse and smooth along the direction of the raindrops, whereas on the other hand, clean videos exhibit piecewise smoothness along the rain-perpendicular direction and continuity along the temporal direction. Theses smoothness and continuity results in the sparse distribution in the different directional gradient domain, respectively. Thus, we minimize 1) the $\ell_1$ norm to enhance the sparsity of the underlying rain streaks, 2) two $\ell_1$ norm of unidirectional Total Variation (TV) regularizers to guarantee the anisotropic spatial smoothness, and 3) an $\ell_1$ norm of the time-directional difference operator to characterize the temporal continuity. A split augmented Lagrangian shrinkage algorithm (SALSA) based algorithm is designed to solve the proposed minimization model. Experiments conducted on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. According to comprehensive quantitative performance measures, our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods especially on account of the running time.

Current rain removal methods show limitations either for complex dynamic scenes, or under torrential rain with opaque occlusions. We propose a novel derain framework which applies superpixel (SP) segmentation to decompose the scene into depth consistent units. Alignment of scene contents are done at the SP level, which proves to be robust against rain occlusion interferences and fast camera motion. Two alignment output tensors, i.e., optimal temporal match tensor and sorted spatial-temporal match tensor, provide informative clues for the location of rain streaks and the occluded background contents. Different classical and novel methods such as Robust Principle Component Analysis and Convolutional Neural Networks are applied and compared for their respective advantages in efficiently exploiting the rich spatial-temporal features provided by the two tensors. Extensive evaluations show that advantage of up to 5dB is achieved on the scene restoration PSNR over state-of-the-art methods, and the advantage is especially obvious with highly complex and dynamic scenes. Visual evaluations show that the proposed framework is not only able to suppress heavy and opaque occluding rain streaks, but also large semi-transparent regional fluctuations and distortions.},

  abstract     = {Coronal rain is the well-known phenomenon in which hot plasma high in the Sun's corona undergoes rapid cooling (from > 10^6 K to < 10^4 K), condenses, and falls to the surface. Coronal rain appears frequently in active region coronal loops and is very common in post-flare loops. This Letter presents discovery observations, which show that coronal rain is ubiquitous in the embedded bipole very near a coronal hole boundary. Our observed structures formed when the photospheric decay of active region leading sunspots resulted in a large parasitic polarity embedded in a background unipolar region. We observe coronal rain to appear within the legs of closed loops well under the fan surface, as well as preferentially near separatrices of the resulting coronal topology: the spine lines, null point, and fan surface. We analyze 3 events using SDO Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations in the 304, 171, and 211 {/AA} channels, as well as SDO Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms. The frequency of rain formation and the ease with which it is observed strongly suggests that this phenomenon is generally present in null-point topologies of this size scale. We argue that these rain events could be explained by the classic process of thermal nonequilibrium or via interchange reconnection at the null; it is also possible that both mechanisms are present. Further studies with higher spatial resolution data and MHD simulations will be required to determine the exact mechanism(s).},

Most of current DL architectures, however, are still lack of sufficient interpretability and not fully integrated with physical structures inside general rain streaks. To this issue, in this paper, we propose a model-driven deep neural network for the task, with fully interpretable network structures. Specifically, based on the convolutional dictionary learning mechanism for representing rain, we propose a novel single image deraining model and utilize the proximal gradient descent technique to design an iterative algorithm only containing simple operators for solving the model. Such a simple implementation scheme facilitates us to unfold it into a new deep network architecture, called rain convolutional dictionary network (RCDNet), with almost every network module one-to-one corresponding to each operation involved in the algorithm. By end-to-end training the proposed RCDNet, all the rain kernels and proximal operators can be automatically extracted, faithfully characterizing the features of both rain and clean background layers, and thus naturally lead to its better deraining performance, especially in real scenarios. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the superiority of the proposed network, especially its well generality to diverse testing scenarios and good interpretability for all its modules, as compared with state-of-the-arts both visually and quantitatively.

  abstract    = {Using extreme-ultraviolet images, we recently proposed a new and alternative formation mechanism for coronal rain along magnetically open field lines due to interchange magnetic reconnection. In this paper we report coronal rain at chromospheric and transition region temperatures originating from the coronal condensations facilitated by reconnection between open and closed coronal loops. For this, we employ the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Around 2013 October 19, a coronal rain along curved paths was recorded by IRIS over the southeastern solar limb. Related to this, we found reconnection between a system of higher-lying open features and lower-lying closed loops that occurs repeatedly in AIA images. In this process, the higher-lying features form magnetic dips. In response, two sets of newly reconnected loops appear and retract away from the reconnection region. In the dips, seven events of cooling and condensation of coronal plasma repeatedly occur due to thermal instability over several days, from October 18 to 20. The condensations flow downward to the surface as coronal rain, with a mean interval between condensations of 6.6 hr. In the cases where IRIS data were available we found the condensations to cool all the way down to chromospheric temperatures. Based on our observations we suggest that some of the coronal rain events observed at chromospheric temperatures could be explained by the new and alternative scenario for the formation of coronal rain, where the condensation is facilitated by interchange reconnection.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {While deep learning (DL)-based video deraining methods have achieved significant success recently, they still exist two major drawbacks. Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics. Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed semi-supervised deraining model.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Severe weather conditions such as rain and snow adversely affect the visual quality of images captured under such conditions thus rendering them useless for further usage and sharing. In addition, such degraded images drastically affect performance of vision systems. Hence, it is important to solve the problem of single image de-raining/de-snowing. However, this is a difficult problem to solve due to its inherent ill-posed nature. Existing approaches attempt to introduce prior information to convert it into a well-posed problem. In this paper, we investigate a new point of view in addressing the single image de-raining problem. Instead of focusing only on deciding what is a good prior or a good framework to achieve good quantitative and qualitative performance, we also ensure that the de-rained image itself does not degrade the performance of a given computer vision algorithm such as detection and classification. In other words, the de-rained result should be indistinguishable from its corresponding clear image to a given discriminator. This criterion can be directly incorporated into the optimization framework by using the recently introduced conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). To minimize artifacts introduced by GANs and ensure better visual quality, a new refined loss function is introduced. Based on this, we propose a novel single image de-raining method called Image De-raining Conditional General Adversarial Network (ID-CGAN), which considers quantitative, visual and also discriminative performance into the objective function. Experiments evaluated on synthetic images and real images show that the proposed method outperforms many recent state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we analyse coordinated observations spanning chromospheric, TR and coronal temperatures at very high resolution which reveal essential characteristics of thermally unstable plasmas. Coronal rain is found to be a highly multi-thermal phenomenon with a high degree of co-spatiality in the multi-wavelength emission. EUV darkening and quasi-periodic intensity variations are found to be strongly correlated to coronal rain showers. Progressive cooling of coronal rain is observed, leading to a height dependence of the emission. A fast-slow two-step catastrophic cooling progression is found, which may reflect the transition to optically thick plasma states. The intermittent and clumpy appearance of coronal rain at coronal heights becomes more continuous and persistent at chromospheric heights just before impact, mainly due to a funnel effect from the observed expansion of the magnetic field. Strong density inhomogeneities on spatial scales of 0.2"-0.5" are found, in which TR to chromospheric temperature transition occurs at the lowest detectable scales. The shape of the distribution of coronal rain widths is found to be independent of temperature with peaks close to the resolution limit of each telescope, ranging from 0.2" to 0.8". However we find a sharp increase of clump numbers at the coolest wavelengths and especially at higher resolution, suggesting that the bulk of the rain distribution remains undetected. Rain clumps appear organised in strands in both chromospheric and TR temperatures, suggesting an important role of thermal instability in the shaping of fundamental loop substructure. We further find structure reminiscent of the MHD thermal mode. Rain core densities are estimated to vary between 2x10^{10} cm^{-3} and 2.5x10^{11} cm^{-3} leading to significant downward mass fluxes per loop of 1-5x10^{9} g s^{-1}, suggesting a major role in the chromosphere-corona mass cycle.},

Based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we directly learn the mapping relationship between rainy and clean image detail layers from data. Because we do not possess the ground truth corresponding to real-world rainy images, we synthesize images with rain for training. In contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective function and improve deraining with a modestly-sized CNN. Specifically, we train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing. Moreover, we augment the CNN framework with image enhancement to improve the visual results. Compared with state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods, our method has improved rain removal and much faster computation time after network training.},

Their detection and the understanding of their formation, morphology and thermodynamical characteristics can provide important information on their hosting environment, especially concerning the magnetic field, whose understanding constitutes a major problem in solar physics. An example of such blobs is coronal rain, a phenomenon of thermal non- equilibrium observed in active region loops, which consists of cool and dense chromospheric blobs falling along loop-like paths from coronal heights. So far, only off-limb coronal rain has been observed and few reports on the phenomenon exist. In the present work, several datasets of on-disk H{\alpha} observations with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) are analyzed. A special family of on-disk blobs is selected for each dataset and a statistical analysis is carried out on their dynamics, morphology and temperatures. All characteristics present distributions which are very similar to reported coronal rain statistics. We discuss possible interpretations considering other similar blob-like structures reported so far and show that a coronal rain interpretation is the most likely one. Their chromospheric nature and the projection effects (which eliminate all direct possibility of height estimation) on one side, and their small sizes, fast dynamics, and especially, their faint character (offering low contrast with the background intensity) on the other side, are found as the main causes for the absence until now of the detection of this on-disk coronal rain counterpart.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, deep learning based methods have made significant progress in rain-removing. However, the existing methods usually do not have good generalization ability, which leads to the fact that almost all of existing methods have a satisfied performance on removing a specific type of rain streaks, but may have a relatively poor performance on other types of rain streaks. In this paper, aiming at removing multiple types of rain streaks from single images, we propose a novel deraining framework (GRASPP-GAN), which has better generalization capacity. Specifically, a modified ResNet-18 which extracts the deep features of rainy images and a revised ASPP structure which adapts to the various shapes and sizes of rain streaks are composed together to form the backbone of our deraining network. Taking the more prominent characteristics of rain streaks in the gradient domain into consideration, a gradient loss is introduced to help to supervise our deraining training process, for which, a Sobel convolution layer is built to extract the gradient information flexibly. To further boost the performance, an adversarial learning scheme is employed for the first time to train the proposed network. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art deraining methods quantitatively and qualitatively. In addition, without any modifications, our proposed framework also achieves good visual performance on dehazing.},

We present an observation of magnetic reconnection in the corona and the associated impulsive heating triggering formation of coronal rain condensations. We analyse combined SDO/AIA and IRIS observations of a coronal rain event following a reconnection between threads of a low-lying prominence flux rope and surrounding coronal field lines. The reconnection of the twisted flux rope and open field lines leads to a release of magnetic twist. Evolution of the emission of one of the coronal loops involved in the reconnection process in different AIA bandpasses suggests that the loop becomes thermally unstable and is subject to the formation of coronal rain condensations following the reconnection and that the associated heating is localised in the upper part of the loop leg. We conclude that in addition to the standard models of thermally unstable coronal loops with heating localised exclusively in the footpoints, thermal instability and subsequent formation of condensations can be triggered by the impulsive heating associated with magnetic reconnection occurring anywhere along a magnetic field line.},

Previous works mainly focused on feature extraction and processing or neural network structure, while the current rain removal methods can already achieve remarkable results, training based on single network structure without considering the cross-scale relationship may cause information drop-out. In this paper, we explore the cross-scale manner between networks and inner-scale fusion operation to solve the image rain removal task. Specifically, to learn features with different scales, we propose a multi-sub-networks structure, where these sub-networks are fused via a crossscale manner by Gate Recurrent Unit to inner-learn and make full use of information at different scales in these sub-networks. Further, we design an inner-scale connection block to utilize the multi-scale information and features fusion way between different scales to improve rain representation ability and we introduce the dense block with skip connection to inner-connect these blocks. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms over the state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, we build a full Bayesian generative model for rainy image where the rain layer is parameterized as a generator with the input as some latent variables representing the physical structural rain factors, e.g., direction, scale, and thickness. To solve this model, we employ the variational inference framework to approximate the expected statistical distribution of rainy image in a data-driven manner. With the learned generator, we can automatically and sufficiently generate diverse and non-repetitive training pairs so as to efficiently enrich and augment the existing benchmark datasets. User study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the realism of generated rainy images. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the proposed model can faithfully extract the complex rain distribution that not only helps significantly improve the deraining performance of current deep single image derainers, but also largely loosens the requirement of large training sample pre-collection for the SIRR task.},

However, under adverse weather conditions (such as water fog, dust fog, rain and snow), the link degradation due to weather particles and gaseous molecules will affect the link secrecy performance seriously. In this work, we present theoretical investigations on physical layer security of a point-to-point THz link in rain and snow with a potential eavesdropper locating outside of the legitimate link path. Signal degradation due to rain/snow, gaseous attenuation and beam divergence are included in a theoretical model to estimate the link performance. Secrecy capacity of the link with carriers at 140, 220 and 340 GHz is calculated and compared. Insecure regions are also presented and the secrecy performance is analyzed.

While recent convolutional neural network-based deraining models have succeeded in capturing rain streaks effectively, difficulties in recovering the details in rain-free images still remain. In this paper, we present a multi-level connection and adaptive regional attention network (MARA-Net) to properly restore the original background textures in rainy images. The first main idea is a multi-level connection design that repeatedly connects multi-level features of the encoder network to the decoder network. Multi-level connections encourage the decoding process to use the feature information of all levels. Channel attention is considered in multi-level connections to learn which level of features is important in the decoding process of the current level. The second main idea is a wide regional non-local block (WRNL). As rain streaks primarily exhibit a vertical distribution, we divide the grid of the image into horizontally-wide patches and apply a non-local operation to each region to explore the rich rain-free background information. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the results of the joint deraining and segmentation experiment prove that our model contributes effectively to other vision tasks.},

  abstract    = {We present here one of the first high resolution spectroscopic observations of coronal rain, performed with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish Solar Telescope. This work constitutes the first attempt to assess the importance of coronal rain in the understanding of the coronal magnetic field in active regions. A large statistical set is obtained in which dynamics (total velocities and accelerations), shapes (lengths and widths), trajectories (angles of fall) and thermodynamic properties (temperatures) of the condensations are derived. Specifically, we find that coronal rain is composed of small and dense chromospheric cores with average widths and lengths of 310 km and 710 km respectively, average temperatures below 7000 K, displaying a broad distribution of falling speeds with an average of 70 km/s and accelerations largely below the effective gravity along loops. Through estimates of the ion-neutral coupling in the blobs we show that coronal rain acts as a tracer of the coronal magnetic field, thus supporting the multi-strand loop scenario, and acts as a probe of the local thermodynamic conditions in loops. We further find that the cooling in neighboring strands occurs simultaneously in general suggesting a similar thermodynamic evolution among strands, which can be explained by a common footpoint heating process. Constraints for coronal heating models of loops are thus provided. Estimates of the fraction of coronal volume with coronal rain give values between 7% and 30%. Estimates of the occurrence time of the phenomenon in loops set times between 5 and 20 hours, implying that coronal rain may be a common phenomenon, in agreement with the frequent observations of cool downflows in EUV lines. The coronal mass drain rate in the form of coronal rain is estimated to be on the order of 5x10^9 g/s, a significant quantity compared to the estimate of mass flux into the corona from spicules.},

While these extreme hyperthermophiles contain proteins, our study shows the absence of DNA in these organisms, indicating a new primitive domain of life with alternate thermostable genetics.

In the pure model sandy soil, the retained water curve measurements indicate that instead of a stable horizontal wetting front that grows downward uniformly, a narrow fingered flow forms under the top layer of water-saturated soil. This rain water channelization phenomenon not only further reduces the available rain water in the plant root zone, but also affects the efficiency of soil additives, such as superabsorbent hydrogel particles. Our studies show that the shape of the retained water curve for a soil packing with hydrogel particle additives strongly depends on the location and the concentration of the hydrogel particles in the model sandy soil. By carefully choosing the particle size and distribution methods, we may use the swollen hydrogel particles to modify the soil pore structure, to clog or extend the water channels in sandy soils, or to build water reservoirs in the plant root zone.},

This model is constructed through a space-time Gaussian random field (GRF) with random scaling varying along time or space and time. It can be viewed as a generalization of the purely spatial tRF, and has a hierarchical representation that allows for Bayesian interpretation. Developing appropriate tools for evaluating precipitation models is a crucial part of the model-building process, and we focus on evaluating whether models can produce the observed conditional dry and rain probabilities given that some set of neighboring sites all have rain or all have no rain. These conditional probabilities show that the proposed space-time model has noticeable improvements in some characteristics of joint rainfall occurrences for the data we have considered.},

This is supported by numerical experiments. However, a verification based on the comparison between operational model results and measured data suggests that the opposite is true. This leads to a keen analysis of the overall process, in particular on the role of the tail of the spectrum in modulating the wind input and the white-capping. We suggest that the relationship between white-capping and generation by wind is deeper and more implicative than presently generally assumed.},

  abstract    = {In radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) simulations, convective self-aggregation (CSA) is the spontaneous organization into segregated cloudy and cloud-free regions. Evidence exists for how CSA is stabilized, but how it arises favorably on large domains is not settled. Using large-eddy simulations (LES), we link the spatial organization emerging from the interaction of cold pools (CPs) to CSA. We systematically weaken simulated rain evaporation to reduce maximal CP radii, $R_{\text{max}}$, and find reducing $R_{\text{max}}$ causes CSA to occur earlier. We further identify a typical rain cell generation time and a minimum radius, $R_{\text{min}}$, around a given rain cell, within which the formation of subsequent rain cells is suppressed. Incorporating $R_{\text{min}}$ and $R_{\text{max}}$, we propose a toy model that captures how CSA arises earlier on large domains: when two CPs of radii $r_{i,j}\in[R_{\text{min}},R_{\text{max}}]$ collide, they form a new convective event. These findings imply that interactions between CPs may explain the initial stages of CSA.},

Traditional methods progressively remove rain streaks via different recurrent neural networks. However, these methods fail to yield plausible rain-free images in an efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a residual squeeze-and-excitation network called RSEN for fast image deraining as well as superior deraining performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, RSEN adopts a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture to conduct rain removal in one stage. Besides, both encoder and decoder adopt a novel residual squeeze-and-excitation block as the core of feature extraction, which contains a residual block for producing hierarchical features, followed by a squeeze-and-excitation block for channel-wisely enhancing the resulted hierarchical features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can not only considerably reduce the computational complexity but also significantly improve the deraining performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract    = {Flare-driven coronal rain can manifest from rapidly cooled plasma condensations near coronal loop-tops in thermally unstable post-flare arcades. We detect 5 phases that characterise the post-flare decay: heating, evaporation, conductive cooling dominance for ~120 s, radiative / enthalpy cooling dominance for ~4700 s and finally catastrophic cooling occurring within 35-124 s leading to rain strands with s periodicity of 55-70 s. We find an excellent agreement between the observations and model predictions of the dominant cooling timescales and the onset of catastrophic cooling. At the rain formation site we detect co-moving, multi-thermal rain clumps that undergo catastrophic cooling from ~1 MK to ~22000 K. During catastrophic cooling the plasma cools at a maximum rate of 22700 K s-1 in multiple loop-top sources. We calculated the density of the EUV plasma from the DEM of the multi-thermal source employing regularised inversion. Assuming a pressure balance, we estimate the density of the chromospheric component of rain to be 9.21x10^11 +-1.76x10^11 cm-3 which is comparable with quiescent coronal rain densities. With up to 8 parallel strands in the EUV loop cross section, we calculate the mass loss rate from the post-flare arcade to be as much as 1.98x10^12 +/-4.95x10^11 g s-1. Finally, we reveal a close proximity between the model predictions of 10^5.8 K and the observed properties between 10^5.9 K and 10^6.2 K, that defines the temperature onset of catastrophic cooling. The close correspondence between the observations and numerical models suggests that indeed acoustic waves (with a sound travel time of 68 s) could play an important role in redistributing energy and sustaining the enthalpy-based radiative cooling.},

Thus, source test case generation strategy can make a big impact on the fault detection effectiveness of metamorphic testing. Most of the previous studies on metamorphic testing have used either random test data or existing test cases as source test cases. There has been limited research done on systematic source test case generation for metamorphic testing. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation on the impact of source test case generation techniques on the fault finding effectiveness of metamorphic testing. We evaluated the effectiveness of line coverage, branch coverage, weak mutation and random test generation strategies for source test case generation. The experiments are conducted with 77 methods from 4 open source code repositories. Our results show that by systematically creating source test cases, we can significantly increase the fault finding effectiveness of metamorphic testing. Further, in this paper we introduce a simple metamorphic testing tool called "METtester" that we use to conduct metamorphic testing on these methods.},

In particular, basic testing activities can be automated by invoking test morphisms. Test strategies can be realised as complex combinations of test morphisms. Test processes can be automated by recording, editing and playing test scripts that invoke test morphisms and strategies. Three types of test strategies have been implemented in Morphy: datamorphism combination strategies, cluster border exploration strategies and strategies for test set optimisation via genetic algorithms. This paper focuses on the datamorphism combination strategies by giving their definitions and implementation algorithms.

This renders it difficult to fix a rational criterion through the whole test suite with an explicit significance level. In this paper, we focus on the Non-overlapping Template Matching Test, which is a randomness test included in the NIST statistical test suite. The test uses a parameter called "template" and we can consider a test item for each template. We investigate dependency between two test items by deriving the joint probability density function of the two p-values and propose a transformation to make multi test items independent of each other.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {For two or more classes (or types) of points, nearest neighbor contingency tables (NNCTs) are constructed using nearest neighbor (NN) frequencies and are used in testing spatial segregation of the classes. Pielou's test of independence, Dixon's cell-specific, class-specific, and overall tests are the tests based on NNCTs (i.e., they are NNCT-tests). These tests are designed and intended for use under the null pattern of random labeling (RL) of completely mapped data. However, it has been shown that Pielou's test is not appropriate for testing segregation against the RL pattern while Dixon's tests are. In this article, we compare Pielou's and Dixon's NNCT-tests; introduce the one-sided versions of Pielou's test; extend the use of NNCT-tests for testing complete spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes (which is called \emph{CSR independence}, henceforth). We assess the finite sample performance of the tests by an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study and demonstrate that Dixon's tests are also appropriate for testing CSR independence; but Pielou's test and the corresponding one-sided versions are liberal for testing CSR independence or RL. Furthermore, we show that Pielou's tests are only appropriate when the NNCT is based on a random sample of (base, NN) pairs. We also prove the consistency of the tests under their appropriate null hypotheses. Moreover, we investigate the edge (or boundary) effects on the NNCT-tests and compare the buffer zone and toroidal edge correction methods for these tests. We illustrate the tests on a real life and an artificial data set.},

  abstract    = {The introduction of automated vehicles demands a way to prove their safe operation. However, validating the safety of automated vehicles is still an unsolved problem. While the scenario-based test approach seems to provide a possible solution, it requires the execution of a high amount of test cases. Several test benches, from actual test vehicles to partly or fully simulated environments, are available, but choosing the optimal test bench, e.g. in terms of required execution time and costs, is a difficult task. Every test bench provides different elements, e.g. simulation models which can be used for test case execution. The composition of elements at a specific test bench is called test bench configuration. This test bench configuration determines the actual performance of a test bench and, therefore, whether the run of a particular test case provides valid test case results with respect to the intended purpose, e.g. a safety validation. For an effective and efficient test case execution, a method is required to assign test cases to the most appropriate test bench configuration. Therefore, it is indispensable to have a method to classify test bench configurations in a clear and reproducible manner. In this paper, we propose a method for classifying test benches and test bench configurations and illustrate the classification method with some examples. The classification method serves as a basis for a systematic assignment of test cases to test bench configurations which allows for an effective and efficient test case execution.},

  abstract    = {Growth of software size, lack of resources to perform regression testing, and failure to detect bugs faster have seen increased reliance on continuous integration and test automation. Even with greater hardware and software resources dedicated to test automation, software testing is faced with enormous challenges, resulting in increased dependence on complex mechanisms for automated test case selection and prioritization as part of a continuous integration framework. These mechanisms are currently using simple entities called test cases that are concretely realized as executable scripts. Our key idea is to provide test cases with more reasoning, adaptive behavior and learning capabilities by using the concepts of intelligent software agents. We refer to such test cases as test agents. The model that underlie a test agent is capable of flexible and autonomous actions in order to meet overall testing objectives. Our goal is to increase the decentralization of regression testing by letting test agents to know for themselves when they should be executing, how they should update their purpose, and when they should interact with each other. In this paper, we envision software test agents that display such adaptive autonomous behavior. Emerging developments and challenges regarding the use of test agents are explored-in particular, new research that seeks to use adaptive autonomous agents in software testing.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Mutation testing is used to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites. In recent years, a promising variation called extreme mutation testing emerged that is computationally less expensive. It identifies methods where their functionality can be entirely removed, and the test suite would not notice it, despite having coverage. These methods are called pseudo-tested. In this paper, we compare the execution and analysis times for traditional and extreme mutation testing and discuss what they mean in practice. We look at how extreme mutation testing impacts current software development practices and discuss open challenges that need to be addressed to foster industry adoption. For that, we conducted an industrial case study consisting of running traditional and extreme mutation testing in a large software project from the semiconductor industry that is covered by a test suite of more than 11,000 unit tests. In addition to that, we did a qualitative analysis of 25 pseudo-tested methods and interviewed two experienced developers to see how they write unit tests and gathered opinions on how useful the findings of extreme mutation testing are. Our results include execution times, scores, numbers of executed tests and mutators, reasons why methods are pseudo-tested, and an interview summary. We conclude that the shorter execution and analysis times are well noticeable in practice and show that extreme mutation testing supplements writing unit tests in conjunction with code coverage tools. We propose that pseudo-tested code should be highlighted in code coverage reports and that extreme mutation testing should be performed when writing unit tests rather than in a decoupled session. Future research should investigate how to perform extreme mutation testing while writing unit tests such that the results are available fast enough but still meaningful.},

  abstract    = {We distinguish two general modes of testing for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application environment and tested in a closed-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. Typically, DNNs are subjected to both types of testing during their development life cycle where offline testing is applied immediately after DNN training and online testing follows after offline testing and once a DNN is deployed within a specific application environment. In this paper, we study the relationship between offline and online testing. Our goal is to determine how offline testing and online testing differ or complement one another and if we can use offline testing results to run fewer tests during online testing to reduce the testing cost. Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end controls of steering functions of self-driving vehicles. Our results show that offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing. Further, we cannot use offline testing results to run fewer tests during online testing in practice since we are not able to identify specific situations where offline testing could be as accurate as online testing in identifying safety requirement violations.},

We advocate that configuration values should be systematically tested like software code and that configuration testing should be a key reliability engineering practice for preventing misconfigurations from production deployment. The essential advantage of configuration testing is to put the configuration values (to be deployed) in the context of the target software program under test. In this way, the dynamic effects of configuration values and the impact of configuration changes can be observed during testing. Configuration testing overcomes the fundamental limitations of de facto approaches to combatting misconfigurations, namely configuration validation and software testing--the former is disconnected from code logic and semantics, while the latter can hardly cover all possible configuration values and their combinations. Our preliminary results show the effectiveness of configuration testing in capturing real-world misconfigurations. We present the principles of writing new configuration tests and the promises of retrofitting existing software tests to be configuration tests. We discuss new adequacy and quality metrics for configuration testing. We also explore regression testing techniques to enable incremental configuration testing during continuous integration and deployment in modern software systems.},

Compared with closed tests EMinP tests have the computational advantage by sharing the benefit of the stepdown procedure of MinP tests and can have a better global power over the tests used to construct closed tests. Furthermore, we argue that EMinP tests may be viewed as a tool to prevent data snooping when two competing tests that have distinct global powers are exploited.

Metamorphic testing has often been used for image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing. In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing approaches to relatively increase test coverage.},

  abstract    = {Executing various sequences of system functions in a system under test represents one of the primary techniques in software testing. The natural way to create effective, consistent and efficient test sequences is to model the system under test and employ an algorithm to generate the tests that satisfy a defined test coverage criterion. Several criteria of test set optimality can be defined. In addition, to optimize the test set from an economic viewpoint, the priorities of the various parts of the system model under test must be defined. Using this prioritization, the test cases exercise the high priority parts of the system under test more intensely than those with low priority. Evidence from the literature and our observations confirm that finding a universal algorithm that produces an optimal test set for all test coverage and test set optimality criteria is a challenging task. Moreover, for different individual problem instances, different algorithms provide optimal results. In this paper, we present a path-based strategy to perform optimal test selection. The strategy first employs a set of current algorithms to generate test sets; then, it assesses the optimality of each test set by the selected criteria, and finally, chooses the optimal test set. The experimental results confirm the validity and usefulness of this strategy. For individual instances of 50 system under test models, different algorithms provided optimal results; these results varied by the required test coverage level, the size of the priority parts of the model, and the selected test set optimality criteria.},

  abstract    = {Testing processes and workflows in information and Internet of Things systems is a major part of the typical software testing effort. Consistent and efficient path-based test cases are desired to support these tests. Because certain parts of software system workflows have a higher business priority than others, this fact has to be involved in the generation of test cases. In this paper, we propose a Prioritized Process Test (PPT), which is a model-based test case generation algorithm that represents an alternative to currently established algorithms that use directed graphs and test requirements to model the system under test. The PPT accepts a directed multigraph as a model to express priorities, and edge weights are used instead of test requirements. To determine the test-coverage level of test cases, a test-depth-level concept is used. We compared the presented PPT with five alternatives (i.e., the Process Cycle Test, a naive reduction of test set created by the Process Cycle Test, Brute Force algorithm, Set-covering Based Solution and Matching-based Prefix Graph Solution) for edge coverage and edge-pair coverage. To assess the optimality of the path-based test cases produced by these strategies, we used fourteen metrics based on the properties of these test cases and 59 models that were created for three real-world systems. For all edge coverage, the PPT produced more optimal test cases than the alternatives in terms of the majority of the metrics. For edge-pair coverage, the PPT strategy yielded similar results to those of the alternatives. Thus, the PPT strategy is an applicable alternative, as it reflects both the required test coverage level and the business priority in parallel.},

  abstract    = {Regression testing is performed to provide confidence that changes in a part of software do not affect other parts of the software. An execution of all existing test cases is the best way to re-establish this confidence. However, regression testing is an expensive process---there might be insufficient resources (e.g., time, workforce) to allow for the re-execution of all test cases. Regression test prioritization techniques attempt to re-order a regression test suite based on some criteria so that highest priority test cases are executed earlier. In this study, we want to prioritize test cases for regression testing based on the dependency network of faults. In software testing, it is common that some faults are consequences of other faults (leading faults). Moreover, dependent faults can be removed if and only if the leading faults have been removed. Our goal is to prioritize test cases so that test cases that exposed leading faults (the most central faults in the fault dependency network) in the system testing phase, are executed first in regression testing. We present ComReg, a test case prioritization technique based on the dependency network of faults. We model a fault dependency network as a directed graph and identify leading faults to prioritize test cases for regression testing. We use a centrality aggregation technique which considers six network representative centrality metrics to identify leading faults in the fault dependency network. We also discuss the use of fault communities to select an arbitrary percentage of the test cases from a prioritized regression test suite. We conduct a case study that evaluates the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.},

  abstract    = {As per leading IT experts, today's large enterprises are going through business transformations. They are adopting service-based IT models such as SOA to develop their enterprise information systems and applications. In fact, SOA is an integration of loosely-coupled interoperable components, possibly built using heterogeneous software technologies and hardware platforms. As a result, traditional testing architectures are no more adequate for verifying and validating the quality of SOA systems and whether they are operating to specifications. This paper first discusses the various state-of-the-art methods for testing SOA applications, and then it proposes a novel automated, distributed, cross-platform, and regression testing architecture for SOA systems. The proposed testing architecture consists of several testing units which include test engine, test code generator, test case generator, test executer, and test monitor units. Experiments conducted showed that the proposed testing architecture managed to use parallel agents to test heterogeneous web services whose technologies were incompatible with the testing framework. As future work, testing non-functional aspects of SOA applications are to be investigated so as to allow the testing of such properties as performance, security, availability, and scalability.},

Often, the seed tests from which new tests are derived are manually constructed, or at least simpler than the tests that are produced as the final outputs of such test generators. We propose annotation of generated tests with a provenance (trail) showing how individual generated tests of interest (especially failing tests) derive from seed tests, and how the population of generated tests relates to the original seed tests. In some cases, post-processing of generated tests can invalidate provenance information, in which case we also propose a method for attempting to construct "pseudo-provenance" describing how the tests could have been (partly) generated from seeds.},

Motivated by physical considerations we consider a generalized scenario (that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models in the literature) wherein the test outcome is governed by an arbitrary $\textit{monotone}$ (stochastic) test function $f(\cdot)$, with the test outcome being positive with probability $f(x)$, where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in that pool. For any monotone test function $f(\cdot)$ we present a non-adaptive generalized group-testing scheme that identifies all defective items with high probability. Our scheme requires at most ${\cal O}(d^2\log(n))$ tests for any monotone test function $f(\cdot)$, and at most ${\cal O}(d\log(n))$ in the physically relevant sub-class of $\textit{sensitive}$ test functions (and hence is information-theoretically order-optimal for this sub-class).},

  abstract    = {Testing is an important activity in engineering of industrial software. For such software, testing is usually performed manually by handcrafting test suites based on specific design techniques and domain-specific experience. To support developers in testing, different approaches for producing good test suites have been proposed. In the last couple of years combinatorial testing has been explored with the goal of automatically combining the input values of the software based on a certain strategy. Pairwise testing is a combinatorial technique used to generate test suites by varying the values of each pair of input parameters to a system until all possible combinations of those parameters are created. There is some evidence suggesting that these kinds of techniques are efficient and relatively good at detecting software faults. Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence on the comparison of these combinatorial testing techniques with, what is perceived as, rigorous manually handcrafted testing. In this study we compare pairwise test suites with test suites created manually by engineers for 45 industrial programs. The test suites were evaluated in terms of fault detection, code coverage and number of tests. The results of this study show that pairwise testing, while useful for achieving high code coverage and fault detection for the majority of the programs, is almost as effective in terms of fault detection as manual testing. The results also suggest that pairwise testing is just as good as manual testing at fault detection for 64% of the programs.},

  abstract    = {Common test generators fall into two categories. Generating test inputs at the unit level is fast, but can lead to false alarms when a function is called with inputs that would not occur in a system context. If a generated input at the system level causes a failure, this is a true alarm, as the input could also have come from the user or a third party; but system testing is much slower. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a test generation bridge, which joins the accuracy of system testing with the speed of unit testing. A Test Generation Bridge allows to combine an arbitrary system test generator with an arbitrary unit test generator. It does so by carving parameterized unit tests from system (test) executions. These unit tests run in a context recorded from the system test, but individual parameters are left free for the unit test generator to systematically explore. This allows symbolic test generators such as KLEE to operate on individual functions in the recorded system context. If the test generator detects a failure, we lift the failure-inducing parameter back to the system input; if the failure can be reproduced at the system level, it is reported as a true alarm. Our BASILISK prototype can extract and test units out of complex systems such as a Web/Python/SQLite/C stack; in its evaluation, it achieves a higher coverage than a state-of-the-art system test generator.},

  abstract    = {Developing test code may be a time-consuming task that usually requires much effort and cost, especially when it is done manually. Besides, during this process, developers and testers are likely to adopt bad design choices, which may lead to the introduction of the so-called test smells in test code. Test smells are bad solutions to either implement or design test code. As the test code with test smells increases in size, these tests might become more complex, and as a consequence, much harder to understand and evolve correctly. Therefore, test smells may have a negative impact on the quality and maintenance of test code and may also harm the whole software testing activities. In this context, this study aims to understand whether test professionals non-intentionally insert test smells. We carried out an expert survey to analyze the usage frequency of a set of test smells. Sixty professionals from different companies participated in the survey. We selected 14 widely studied smells from the literature, which are also implemented in existing test smell detection tools. The yielded results indicate that experienced professionals introduce test smells during their daily programming tasks, even when they are using standardized practices from their companies, and not only for their personal assumptions. Another relevant evidence was that developers' professional experience can not be considered as a root-cause for the insertion of test smells in test code.},

Existing approaches are usually guided by the test coverage criteria, generating synthetic test cases that are often difficult to read or understand for developers. In this paper we propose AthenaTest, an approach that aims at generating unit test cases by learning from real-world, developer-written test cases. Our approach relies on a state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence transformer model which is able to write useful test cases for a given method under test (i.e., focal method). We also introduce methods2test - the largest publicly available supervised parallel corpus of unit test case methods and corresponding focal methods in Java, which comprises 630k test cases mined from 70k open-source repositories hosted on GitHub. We use this dataset to train a transformer model to translate focal methods into the corresponding test cases. We evaluate the ability of our model in generating test cases using natural language processing as well as code-specific criteria. First, we assess the quality of the translation compared to the target test case, then we analyze properties of the test case such as syntactic correctness and number and variety of testing APIs (e.g., asserts). We execute the test cases, collect test coverage information, and compare them with test cases generated by EvoSuite and GPT-3. Finally, we survey professional developers on their preference in terms of readability, understandability, and testing effectiveness of the generated test cases.},

In DNN testing, many test coverage metrics have been proposed to measure test effectiveness, including structural coverage and non-structural coverage (which are classified according to whether considering which structural elements are covered during testing). Those test coverage metrics are proposed based on the assumption: they are correlated with test effectiveness (i.e., the generation of adversarial test inputs or the error-revealing capability of test inputs in DNN testing studies). However, it is still unknown whether the assumption is tenable. In this work, we conducted the first extensive study to systematically validate the assumption by controlling for the size of test sets. In the study, we studied seven typical test coverage metrics based on 9 pairs of datasets and models with great diversity (including four pairs that have never been used to evaluate these test coverage metrics before). The results demonstrate that the assumption fails for structural coverage in general but holds for non-structural coverage on more than half of subjects, indicating that measuring the difference of DNN behaviors between test inputs and training data is more promising than measuring which structural elements are covered by test inputs for measuring test effectiveness. Even so, the current non-structural coverage metrics still can be improved from several aspects such as unfriendly parameters and unstable performance. That indicates that although a lot of test coverage metrics have been proposed before, there is still a lot of room for improvement of measuring test effectiveness in DNN testing, and our study has pointed out some promising directions.},

Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) is currently the gold standard for $k$-sample testing but makes strong, often inappropriate, parametric assumptions. Moreover, independence testing and $k$-sample testing are tightly related, and there are many nonparametric multivariate independence tests with strong theoretical and empirical properties, including distance correlation (Dcorr) and Hilbert-Schmidt-Independence-Criterion (Hsic). We prove that universally consistent independence tests achieve universally consistent $k$-sample testing and that $k$-sample statistics like Energy and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) are exactly equivalent to Dcorr. Empirically evaluating these tests for $k$-sample scenarios demonstrates that these nonparametric independence tests typically outperform MANOVA, even for Gaussian distributed settings. Finally, we extend these non-parametric $k$-sample testing procedures to perform multiway and multilevel tests. Thus, we illustrate the existence of many theoretically motivated and empirically performant $k$-sample tests.

Group testing provides an approach to test the entire population using significantly fewer than $N$ tests when infection prevalence is low. The original and most commonly utilized form of group testing, called Dorfman testing, treats each individual's infection probability as independent and homogenous. However, as communicable diseases spread from individual to individual through underlying social networks, an individual's network location affects their infection probability. In this work, we utilize network information to improve group testing. Specifically, we group individuals by community and demonstrate the performance gain over Dorfman testing. After introducing a network and epidemic model, we derive the number of tests used under network grouping. We prove the expected number of tests is upper bounded by Dorfman testing. In addition, we demonstrate network grouping successfully achieves the theoretical lower bound for two-stage testing procedures when networks have strong community structure. On the other hand, network grouping is equivalent to Dorfman testing when networks have no structure. We end by demonstrating network grouping outperforms Dorfman testing in the scenario of a university testing its population for COVID-19 cases.},

This work ignores UI tests that have larger input spaces and more diverse running conditions than traditional unit tests.

In this paper, we perform a study on flaky UI tests. We analyze 235 flaky UI test samples found in 62 projects from both web and Android environments. We identify the common underlying root causes of flakiness in the UI tests, the strategies used to manifest the flaky behavior, and the fixing strategies used to remedy flaky UI tests. The findings made in this work can provide a foundation for the development of detection and prevention techniques for flakiness arising in UI tests.},

  abstract    = {The process of testing any software system is an enormous task which is time consuming and costly. The time and required effort to do sufficient testing grow, as the size and complexity of the software grows, which may cause overrun of the project budget, delay in the development of software system or some test cases may not be covered. During SDLC (software development life cycle), generally the software testing phase takes around 40-70% of the time and cost. State-based testing is frequently used in software testing. Test data generation is one of the key issues in software testing. A properly generated test suite may not only locate the errors in a software system, but also help in reducing the high cost associated with software testing. It is often desired that test data in the form of test sequences within a test suite can be automatically generated to achieve required test coverage. This paper proposes an optimization approach to test data generation for the state-based software testing. In this paper, first state transition graph is derived from state chart diagram. Then, all the required information are extracted from the state chart diagram. Then, test cases are generated. Lastly, a set of test cases are minimized by calculating the node coverage for each test case. It is also determined that which test cases are covered by other test cases. The advantage of our test generation technique is that it optimizes test coverage by minimizing time and cost. The proposed test data generation scheme generates test cases which satisfy transition path coverage criteria, path coverage criteria and action coverage criteria. A case study on Automatic Ticket Machine (ATM) has been presented to illustrate our approach.},

  abstract     = {Software testing is the important phase of software development process. But, this phase can be easily missed by software developers because of their limited time to complete the project. Since, software developers finish their software nearer to the delivery time; they dont get enough time to test their program by creating effective test cases. . One of the major difficulties in software testing is the generation of test cases that satisfy the given adequacy criterion Moreover, creating manual test cases is a tedious work for software developers in the final rush hours. A new approach which generates test cases can help the software developers to create test cases from software specifications in early stage of software development (before coding) and as well as from program execution traces from after software development (after coding). Heuristic techniques can be applied for creating quality test cases. Mutation testing is a technique for testing software units that has great potential for improving the quality of testing, and to assure the high reliability of software. In this paper, a mutation testing based test cases generation technique has been proposed to generate test cases from program execution trace, so that the test cases can be generated after coding. The paper details about the mutation testing implementation to generate test cases. The proposed algorithm has been demonstrated for an example.},

  abstract    = {NIST SP800-22 is one of the most widely used statistical testing tools for pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). This tool consists of 15 tests (one-level tests) and two additional tests (two-level tests). Each one-level test provides one or more $p$-values. The two-level tests measure the uniformity of the obtained $p$-values for a fixed one-level test. One of the two-level tests categorizes the $p$-values into ten intervals of equal length, and apply a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. This two-level test is often more powerful than one-level tests, but sometimes it rejects even good PRNGs when the sample size at the second level is too large, since it detects approximation errors in the computation of $p$-values. In this paper, we propose a practical upper limit of the sample size in this two-level test, for each of six tests appeared in SP800-22. These upper limits are derived by the chi-squared discrepancy between the distribution of the approximated $p$-values and the uniform distribution $U(0, 1)$. We also computed a "risky" sample size at the second level for each one-level test. Our experiments show that the two-level test with the proposed upper limit gives appropriate results, while using the risky size often rejects even good PRNGs. We also propose another improvement: to use the exact probability for the ten categories in the computation of goodness-of-fit at the two-level test. This allows us to increase the sample size at the second level, and would make the test more sensitive than the NIST's recommending usage.},

  abstract     = {Lean processes focus on doing only necessery things in an efficient way. Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning offer new opportunities to optimizing processes. The presented approach demonstrates an improvement of the test process by using Machine Learning as a support tool for test management. The scope is the semi-automation of the selection of regression tests. The proposed lean testing process uses Machine Learning as a supporting machine, while keeping the human test manager in charge of the adequate test case selection. 1 Introduction Many established long running projects and programs are execute regression tests during the release tests. The regression tests are the part of the release test to ensure that functionality from past releases still works fine in the new release. In many projects, a significant part of these regression tests are not automated and therefore executed manually. Manual tests are expensive and time intensive [1], which is why often only a relevant subset of all possible regression tests are executed in order to safe time and money. Depending on the software process, different approaches can be used to identify the right set of regression tests. The source code file level is a frequent entry point for this identification [2]. Advanced approaches combine different file level methods [3]. To handle black-box tests, methods like [4] or [5] can be used for test case prioritiza-tion. To decide which tests can be skipped, a relevance ranking of the tests in a regression test suite is needed. Based on the relevance a test is in or out of the regression test set for a specific release. This decision is a task of the test manager supported by experts. The task can be time-consuming in case of big (often a 4-to 5-digit number) regression test suites because the selection is specific to each release. Trends are going to continuous prioritization [6], which this work wants to support with the presented ML based approach for black box regression test case prioritization. Any regression test selection is made upon release specific changes. Changes can be new or deleted code based on refactoring or implementation of new features. But also changes on externals systems which are connected by interfaces have to be considered},

  abstract    = {This work studies IRT-based Automated Test Assembly (ATA) of multiple test forms (tests) that meet an absolute target information function, i.e. selecting from an item bank only the tests that have information functions that are at a small distance away from the target. The authors introduce the quantities multiplicity of tests and probability of selecting a test with particular number of items N and distance E from the target. A Grand Canonical Monte Carlo test-assembly algorithm is proposed that selects tests according to this probability. The algorithm allows N to vary during the simulation. This work demonstrates that the number of tests that meet the target depends strongly on N. The algorithm is capable of finding tests with small values of E and various values of N depending on the need of the test constructor. Most importantly, it can determine the optimal N for which a maximal number of tests with certain specified small E exists.},

  abstract    = {We can never be certain that a software system is correct simply by testing it, but with every additional successful test we become less uncertain about its correctness. In absence of source code or elaborate specifications and models, tests are usually generated or chosen randomly. However, rather than randomly choosing tests, it would be preferable to choose those tests that decrease our uncertainty about correctness the most. In order to guide test generation, we apply what is referred to in Machine Learning as "Query Strategy Framework": We infer a behavioural model of the system under test and select those tests which the inferred model is "least certain" about. Running these tests on the system under test thus directly targets those parts about which tests so far have failed to inform the model. We provide an implementation that uses a genetic programming engine for model inference in order to enable an uncertainty sampling technique known as "query by committee", and evaluate it on eight subject systems from the Apache Commons Math framework and JodaTime. The results indicate that test generation using uncertainty sampling outperforms conventional and Adaptive Random Testing.},

In practice, code-coverage metrics are often used as criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites with focus on regression faults. However, code coverage only expresses which portion of a system has been executed by tests, but not how effective the tests actually are in detecting regression faults. Our goal was to evaluate the validity of code coverage as a measure for test effectiveness. To do so, we conducted an empirical study in which we applied an extreme mutation testing approach to analyze the tests of open-source projects written in Java. We assessed the ratio of pseudo-tested methods (those tested in a way such that faults would not be detected) to all covered methods and judged their impact on the software project. The results show that the ratio of pseudo-tested methods is acceptable for unit tests but not for system tests (that execute large portions of the whole system). Therefore, we conclude that the coverage metric is only a valid effectiveness indicator for unit tests.},

The optimal nested test plan offering this performance, however, was not obtained. In this work, we establish the optimal nested test plan in closed form. This optimal nested test plan is also order optimal among all test plans as the population size approaches infinity. Using heavy-hitter detection as a case study, we show via simulation examples orders of magnitude improvement of the group testing approach over two prevailing sampling-based approaches in detection accuracy and counter consumption.

The asymptotic random expression of this test statistic under the null hypothesis is obtained. To approximate the null distribution of the proposed test statistic, we describe a parametric bootstrap method and a non-parametric bootstrap method. The asymptotic random expression of the proposed test is also studied under a local alternative and it is shown that the proposed test is root-$n$ consistent. Intensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed test and it turns out that the proposed test is indeed more powerful than some existing tests when functional data are highly correlated. The proposed test is illustrated with three real data examples.},

It is shown that the generalized permutation tests are exact, and a partial converse: that any test function that is exact on all probability densities coincides with a generalized permutation test on a particular region, is established. A most powerful generalized permutation test is derived in closed form. Approximations to the most powerful generalized permutation test are proposed to reduce the computational burden required to compute the complete test. In particular, an explicit form for the approximate test is derived in terms of a multinomial Bernstein polynomial approximation, and its convergence to the most powerful generalized permutation test is demonstrated. In the case where the determination of p-values is of greater interest than testing of hypotheses, two approaches to estimation of significance are analyzed. Bounds on the deviation from significance of the exact most powerful test are given in terms of sample size. For both estimators, as sample size approaches infinity, the estimator converges to the significance of the most powerful generalized permutation test under mild conditions. Applications of generalized permutation testing to linear mixed models are provided.},

In this article, we propose Adaptive Metamorphic Testing as a generalization of a simple yet powerful reinforcement learning technique, namely contextual bandits, to select one of the multiple metamorphic relations available for a program. By using contextual bandits, Adaptive Metamorphic Testing learns which metamorphic relations are likely to transform a source test case, such that it has higher chance to discover faults. We present experimental results over two major case studies in machine learning, namely image classification and object detection, and identify weaknesses and robustness boundaries. Adaptive Metamorphic Testing efficiently identifies weaknesses of the tested systems in context of the source test case.},

Due to its importance and high practical relevance several risk-based testing approaches were proposed in academia and industry. This paper presents a taxonomy of risk-based testing providing a framework to understand, categorize, assess, and compare risk-based testing approaches to support their selection and tailoring for specific purposes. The taxonomy is aligned with the consideration of risks in all phases of the test process and consists of the top-level classes risk drivers, risk assessment, and risk-based test process. The taxonomy of risk-based testing has been developed by analyzing the work presented in available publications on risk-based testing. Afterwards, it has been applied to the work on risk-based testing presented in this special section of the International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer.},

  abstract    = {New binary classification tests are often evaluated relative to a pre-established test. For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this paper, I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous information when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called dilation -- an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an example, I present hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO's minimum quality requirement for rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The ambiguity in the information arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test: the joint distribution of true infection and test results is not observed. Using results from Copula theory, I construct the (usually non-singleton) set of all these possible joint distributions, which allows me to assess the new test's informativeness. This analysis leads to a simple sufficient condition to make sure that a new test is not a dilation. I illustrate my approach with applications to data from three COVID-19 related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests satisfy my sufficient condition easily and are therefore informative. However, less accurate procedures, like chest CT scans, may exhibit dilation.},

  abstract    = {A common and natural intuition among software testers is that test cases need to differ if a software system is to be tested properly and its quality ensured. Consequently, much research has gone into formulating distance measures for how test cases, their inputs and/or their outputs differ. However, common to these proposals is that they are data type specific and/or calculate the diversity only between pairs of test inputs, traces or outputs. We propose a new metric to measure the diversity of sets of tests: the test set diameter (TSDm). It extends our earlier, pairwise test diversity metrics based on recent advances in information theory regarding the calculation of the normalized compression distance (NCD) for multisets. An advantage is that TSDm can be applied regardless of data type and on any test-related information, not only the test inputs. A downside is the increased computational time compared to competing approaches. Our experiments on four different systems show that the test set diameter can help select test sets with higher structural and fault coverage than random selection even when only applied to test inputs. This can enable early test design and selection, prior to even having a software system to test, and complement other types of test automation and analysis. We argue that this quantification of test set diversity creates a number of opportunities to better understand software quality and provides practical ways to increase it.},

  abstract    = {Hypothesis testing is a useful statistical tool in determining whether a given model should be rejected based on a sample from the population. Sample data may contain sensitive information about individuals, such as medical information. Thus it is important to design statistical tests that guarantee the privacy of subjects in the data. In this work, we study hypothesis testing subject to differential privacy, specifically chi-squared tests for goodness of fit for multinomial data and independence between two categorical variables. We propose new tests for goodness of fit and independence testing that like the classical versions can be used to determine whether a given model should be rejected or not, and that additionally can ensure differential privacy. We give both Monte Carlo based hypothesis tests as well as hypothesis tests that more closely follow the classical chi-squared goodness of fit test and the Pearson chi-squared test for independence. Crucially, our tests account for the distribution of the noise that is injected to ensure privacy in determining significance. We show that these tests can be used to achieve desired significance levels, in sharp contrast to direct applications of classical tests to differentially private contingency tables which can result in wildly varying significance levels. Moreover, we study the statistical power of these tests. We empirically show that to achieve the same level of power as the classical non-private tests our new tests need only a relatively modest increase in sample size.},

We study the behavior of local levels when applied to some well-known GOF tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, higher criticism (HC) tests and tests based on phi-divergences. The main focus is on a rigorous characterization of the asymptotic behavior of local levels of the original HC tests which leads to several further asymptotic results for local levels of other GOF tests including GOF tests with equal local levels. While local levels of KS tests, which are related to the central range, are asymptotically strictly larger than zero, all local levels of HC tests converge to zero as the sample size increases. Consequently, there exists no asymptotic level $\alpha$ GOF test such that all local levels are asymptotically bounded away from zero. Finally, by means of numerical computations we compare classical KS and HC tests to a GOF test with equal local levels.},

Like web-based applications, mobile apps suffer from GUI test fragility, i.e. GUI test classes failing due to minor modifications in the GUI, without the application functionalities being altered. Aims. The objective of our study is to examine the diffusion of GUI testing on Android, and the amount of changes required to keep test classes up to date, and in particular the changes due to GUI test fragility. We define metrics to characterize the modifications and evolution of test classes and test methods, and proxies to estimate fragility-induced changes. Method. To perform our experiments, we selected six widely used open-source tools for scripted GUI testing of mobile applications previously described in the literature. We have mined the repositories on GitHub that used those tools, and computed our set of metrics. Results. We found that none of the considered GUI testing frameworks achieved a major diffusion among the open-source Android projects available on GitHub. For projects with GUI tests, we found that test suites have to be modified often, specifically 5\%-10\% of developers' modified LOCs belong to tests, and that a relevant portion (60\% on average) of such modifications are induced by fragility. Conclusions. Fragility of GUI test classes constitute a relevant concern, possibly being an obstacle for developers to adopt automated scripted GUI tests. This first evaluation and measure of fragility of Android scripted GUI testing can constitute a benchmark for developers, and the basis for the definition of a taxonomy of fragility causes, and actionable guidelines to mitigate the issue.},

  abstract    = {In software testing, a set of test cases is constructed according to some predefined selection criteria. The software is then examined against these test cases. Three interesting observations have been made on the current artifacts of software testing. Firstly, an error-revealing test case is considered useful while a successful test case which does not reveal software errors is usually not further investigated. Whether these successful test cases still contain useful information for revealing software errors has not been properly studied. Secondly, no matter how extensive the testing has been conducted in the development phase, errors may still exist in the software [5]. These errors, if left undetected, may eventually cause damage to the production system. The study of techniques for uncovering software errors in the production phase is seldom addressed in the literature. Thirdly, as indicated by Weyuker in [6], the availability of test oracles is pragmatically unattainable in most situations. However, the availability of test oracles is generally assumed in conventional software testing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel test case selection technique that derives new test cases from the successful ones. The selection aims at revealing software errors that are possibly left undetected in successful test cases which may be generated using some existing strategies. As such, the proposed technique augments the effectiveness of existing test selection strategies. The technique also helps uncover software errors in the production phase and can be used in the absence of test oracles.},

  abstract    = {Diversity has been proposed as a key criterion to improve testing effectiveness and efficiency.It can be used to optimise large test repositories but also to visualise test maintenance issues and raise practitioners' awareness about waste in test artefacts and processes. Even though these diversity-based testing techniques aim to exercise diverse behavior in the system under test (SUT), the diversity has mainly been measured on and between artefacts (e.g., inputs, outputs or test scripts). Here, we introduce a family of measures to capture behavioural diversity (b-div) of test cases by comparing their executions and failure outcomes. Using failure information to capture the SUT behaviour has been shown to improve effectiveness of history-based test prioritisation approaches. However, history-based techniques require reliable test execution logs which are often not available or can be difficult to obtain due to flaky tests, scarcity of test executions, etc. To be generally applicable we instead propose to use mutation testing to measure behavioral diversity by running the set of test cases on various mutated versions of the SUT. Concretely, we propose two specific b-div measures (based on accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient, respectively) and compare them with artefact-based diversity (a-div) for prioritising the test suites of 6 different open-source projects. Our results show that our b-div measures outperform a-div and random selection in all of the studied projects. The improvement is substantial with an average increase in average percentage of faults detected (APFD) of between 19% to 31% depending on the size of the subset of prioritised tests.},

We consider they could play an important role for testing high-dimensional data, but currently the classical Rao's score tests for an arbitrary but fixed dimension remain being still not very well-known for tests on correlation matrices of multivariate normal distributions. In this paper, we illustrate how to create Rao's score tests, focussed on testing correlation matrices, showing their asymptotic distribution. Based on Basu et al. (2021), we do not only develop the classical Rao's score tests, but also their robust version, Rao's $\beta$-score tests. Despite of tedious calculations, their strength is the final simple expression, which is valid for any arbitrary but fixed dimension. In addition, we provide basic formulas for creating easily other tests, either for other variants of correlation tests or for location or variability parameters. We perform a simulation study with high-dimensional data and the results are compared to those of the likelihood ratio test with a variety of distributions, either pure and contaminated. The study shows that the classical Rao's score test for correlation matrices seems to work properly not only under multivariate normality but also under other multivariate distributions. Under perturbed distributions, the Rao's $\beta$-score tests outperform any classical test.},

We analyzed 20,340 test cases in 803 classes manually and 170k classes using an automated approach. The results show that: (i) there exists weak correlation (r = 0.655) between the word test and test cases presence in a class; (ii) the proposed algorithm using static file analysis correctly detected 95\% of test cases; (iii) 15\% of the analyzed classes used main() function whose represent regular Java programs that test the production code without using any third-party framework. The identification of such tests is very low due to implementation diversity. The results may be leveraged to more quickly identify and locate test cases in a repository, to understand practices in customized testing solutions and to mine tests to improve program comprehension in the future.},

  abstract    = {There is a growing body of research on developing testing techniques for Deep Neural Networks (DNN). We distinguish two general modes of testing for DNNs: Offline testing where DNNs are tested as individual units based on test datasets obtained independently from the DNNs under test, and online testing where DNNs are embedded into a specific application and tested in a close-loop mode in interaction with the application environment. In addition, we identify two sources for generating test datasets for DNNs: Datasets obtained from real-life and datasets generated by simulators. While offline testing can be used with datasets obtained from either sources, online testing is largely confined to using simulators since online testing within real-life applications can be time-consuming, expensive and dangerous. In this paper, we study the following two important questions aiming to compare test datasets and testing modes for DNNs: First, can we use simulator-generated data as a reliable substitute to real-world data for the purpose of DNN testing? Second, how do online and offline testing results differ and complement each other? Though these questions are generally relevant to all autonomous systems, we study them in the context of automated driving systems where, as study subjects, we use DNNs automating end-to-end control of cars' steering actuators. Our results show that simulator-generated datasets are able to yield DNN prediction errors that are similar to those obtained by testing DNNs with real-life datasets. Further, offline testing is more optimistic than online testing as many safety violations identified by online testing could not be identified by offline testing, while large prediction errors generated by offline testing always led to severe safety violations detectable by online testing.},

  abstract    = {Software testing is sometimes plagued with intermittently failing tests and finding the root causes of such failing tests is often difficult. This problem has been widely studied at the unit testing level for open source software, but there has been far less investigation at the system test level, particularly the testing of industrial embedded systems. This paper describes our investigation of the root causes of intermittently failing tests in the embedded systems domain, with the goal of better understanding, explaining and categorizing the underlying faults. The subject of our investigation is a currently-running industrial embedded system, along with the system level testing that was performed. We devised and used a novel metric for classifying test cases as intermittent. From more than a half million test verdicts, we identified intermittently and consistently failing tests, and identified their root causes using multiple sources. We found that about 1-3% of all test cases were intermittently failing. From analysis of the case study results and related work, we identified nine factors associated with test case intermittence. We found that a fix for a consistently failing test typically removed a larger number of failures detected by other tests than a fix for an intermittent test. We also found that more effort was usually needed to identify fixes for intermittent tests than for consistent tests. An overlap between root causes leading to intermittent and consistent tests was identified. Many root causes of intermittence are the same in industrial embedded systems and open source software. However, when comparing unit testing to system level testing, especially for embedded systems, we observed that the test environment itself is often the cause of intermittence.},

  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {Context: Developers design test suites to automatically verify that software meets its expected behaviors. Many dynamic analysis techniques are performed on the exploitation of execution traces from test cases. However, in practice, there is only one trace that results from the execution of one manually-written test case. Objective: In this paper, we propose a new technique of test suite refactoring, called B-Refactoring. The idea behind B-Refactoring is to split a test case into small test fragments, which cover a simpler part of the control flow to provide better support for dynamic analysis. Method: For a given dynamic analysis technique, our test suite refactoring approach monitors the execution of test cases and identifies small test cases without loss of the test ability. We apply B-Refactoring to assist two existing analysis tasks: automatic repair of if-statements bugs and automatic analysis of exception contracts. Results: Experimental results show that test suite refactoring can effectively simplify the execution traces of the test suite. Three real-world bugs that could previously not be fixed with the original test suite are fixed after applying B-Refactoring; meanwhile, exception contracts are better verified via applying B-Refactoring to original test suites. Conclusions: We conclude that applying B-Refactoring can effectively improve the purity of test cases. Existing dynamic analysis tasks can be enhanced by test suite refactoring.},

  abstract    = {Bioinformatics software plays a very important role in making critical decisions within many areas including medicine and health care. However, most of the research is directed towards developing tools, and little time and effort is spent on testing the software to assure its quality. In testing, a test oracle is used to determine whether a test is passed or failed during testing, and unfortunately, for much of bioinformatics software, the exact expected outcomes are not well defined. Thus, the main challenge associated with conducting systematic testing on bioinformatics software is the oracle problem. Metamorphic testing (MT) is a technique used to test programs that face the oracle problem. MT uses metamorphic relations (MRs) to determine whether a test has passed or failed and specifies how the output should change according to a specific change made to the input. In this work, we use MT to test LingPipe, a tool for processing text using computational linguistics, often used in bioinformatics for bio-entity recognition from biomedical literature. First, we identify a set of MRs for testing any bio-entity recognition program. Then we develop a set of test cases that can be used to test LingPipe's bio-entity recognition functionality using these MRs. To evaluate the effectiveness of this testing process, we automatically generate a set of faulty versions of LingPipe. According to our analysis of the experimental results, we observe that our MRs can detect the majority of these faulty versions, which shows the utility of this testing technique for quality assurance of bioinformatics software.},

  abstract    = {Developers always wish to ensure that their latest changes to the code base do not break existing functionality. If test cases fail, they expect these failures to be connected to the submitted changes. Unfortunately, a flaky test can be the reason for a test failure. Developers spend time to relate possible test failures to the submitted changes only to find out that the cause for these failures is test flakiness. The dilemma of an identification of the real failures or flaky test failures affects developers' perceptions about what is test flakiness. Prior research on test flakiness has been limited to test smells and tools to detect test flakiness. In this paper, we have conducted a multiple case study with four different industries in Scandinavia to understand practitioners' perceptions about test flakiness and how this varies between industries. We observed that there are little differences in how the practitioners perceive test flakiness. We identified 23 factors that are perceived to affect test flakiness. These perceived factors are categorized as 1) Software test quality, 2) Software Quality, 3) Actual Flaky test and 4) Company-specific factors. We have studied the nature of effects such as whether factors increase, decrease or affect the ability to detect test flakiness. We validated our findings with different participants of the 4 companies to avoid biases. The average agreement rate of the identified factors and their effects are 86% and 86% respectively, among participants.},

  abstract    = {Authentication is a critical security feature for confirming the identity of a system's users, typically implemented with help from frameworks like Spring Security. It is a complex feature which should be robustly tested at all stages of development. Unit testing is an effective technique for fine-grained verification of feature behaviors that is not widely-used to test authentication. Part of the problem is that resources to help developers unit test security features are limited. Most security testing guides recommend test cases in a "black box" or penetration testing perspective. These resources are not easily applicable to developers writing new unit tests, or who want a security-focused perspective on coverage. In this paper, we address these issues by applying a grounded theory-based approach to identify common (unit) test cases for token authentication through analysis of 481 JUnit tests exercising Spring Security-based authentication implementations from 53 open source Java projects. The outcome of this study is a developer-friendly unit testing guide organized as a catalog of 53 test cases for token authentication, representing unique combinations of 17 scenarios, 40 conditions, and 30 expected outcomes learned from the data set in our analysis. We supplement the test guide with common test smells to avoid. To verify the accuracy and usefulness of our testing guide, we sought feedback from selected developers, some of whom authored unit tests in our dataset.},

  eprint      = {2012.00673},
  eprintclass = {stat.ME},
  eprinttype  = {arXiv},
  abstract    = {The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic results in unprecedented demand for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known and studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests, especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001 the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases like COVID-19.},
